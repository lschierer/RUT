Biometrics are starting to be deployed commercially according to "[Supermarket:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Let your fingers do the paying](http://news.com.com/Supermarket+Let+your+fingers+do+the+paying/2100-1029_3-5559074.html?part=rss&tag=5559074&subj=news.1029.20)" from [News.com](http://news.com.com). A Seattle Washington\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#grocery store allows you to register a credit or debit card to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a fingerprint, and then pay by fingerprint. While this sounds\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incredibly convenient, there are a myriad of concerns that should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be considered. Even assuming the system used is hard to fool, do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you really want to be uniquely identified with what you purchase?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Stores want to have data about you, consider some of the stuff going\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on with radio id tags, WalmartÂ®; for instance was curious about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what parts of the store people buying various things will visit,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and how long they spend where. Consider if someone did find a way to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fake out the system, how would you go about trying to prove it? Can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you imagine trying to say "yes, I know that my finger print was used,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I didn't really buy that" with a straight face? Do you think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anyone would believe you? Consider something somewhat more mundane.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Now instead of just using your credit card once, they get to store\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#your credit card number. How secure is the server storing it?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Can it be hacked? Can someone walk off with it? Pranas says that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the company he worked for had a server stolen recently. Not only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that, they aren't even sure it was an inside job. If a government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#contractor cannot keep employees personal information secure,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how well do you think a grocery store or convenience store would do?
