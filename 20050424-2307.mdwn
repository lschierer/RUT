Wow, it looks like the Roseville Joint Union\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#High School District in Sacramento, California\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#picked on the wrong parent!! According to [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43953), a Mr. Larry Caldwell is suing the school district\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for violating "his constitutional rights to free speech, equal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#protection and religious freedom." He is also seeking a retraction\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from a Eugenie Scott, who has some connection to the case that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is not made clear. This Scott person (is "Eugenie" a guy's name\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or a girl's name?) apparently rather drastically misrepresented\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr Caldwell's proposal and position. It really is not atypical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for Darwinists to do this, to try to make you look like a rabidly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fanatical evangelical. They do this so that anyone except another\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rabidly fanatical evangelical (or someone like me who is familiar\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with their tactics) will dismiss you out of hand without considering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#your arguments. They cannot win on the merits you see, because\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Intelligent Design" really is not saying anything most people would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#disagree with. It is about time someone took advantage of the fact\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that they can't keep the straw-man attacks out of the debate!
