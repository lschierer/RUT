The First Amendment does not apply to contempt of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#court. This common sense decision is documented in "[CIA leak\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reporters 'must testify'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4268129.stm)" and is a decision that many will find\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an offensive abridgment of said amendment. Still, I tend to agree\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with this decision (hence calling it common sense ;-), it seems to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#me that their ability to print whatever is not being restricted, only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their ability to \*withhold\* information. And withholding information\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seems to be covered only under self incrimination and unreasonable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#search, not under freedom of the press. As testifying would free\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them from guilt, it isn't self incrimination, and it seems that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unreasonable search isn't being argued. So testify they must. :-)
