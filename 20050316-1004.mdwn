[Yesterday](./view.php?date=20050315-1403)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I referenced a pair of articles on Terri Schiavo,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Florida woman whose husband wants to let her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#die so that he can marry another woman and keep her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#money. Today, I am reminded of this by Chuck Colson's "[Life\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or death in Florida](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/chuckcolson/cc20050311.shtml)." I often disagree with Mr. Colson, he can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get Protestant-preachy, but this article nicely sums up the fact that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people we think are unaware sometimes are aware, the sketchiness of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Schiavo's own position, and the lamentable, deplorably lack of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#protection that Terri Schiavo is receiving, protection that one would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have thought would be built into our system. As Mr. Colson says,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"As things stand, any convicted felon on death row would now be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#granted more rights than Terri. At least the felon would be allowed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#legal representation."
