"[Quantum\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#leap in secure web video](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4496893.stm)" Quantum cryptography. Apparently they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have keys that only work one time. So you can miss messages,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but you'll know it. And they change fast, so cracking one key\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#isn't all that good. But I am still unsure, reading this, how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they send the keys so that there is a good chance of most of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#messages getting through unread, they still have to transport the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#key *somehow*.

"[US\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#export rules block space plan](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4506133.stm)" US rules block[ed?] cryptography\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#export, so quite a bit of it moved overseas. Especially in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#open software world. Will we see the same here?

"\>Sony's Qrio robot\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#attending nursery school in California" mentions that they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have been sending a humanoid robot to play with preschool kids.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They claim its "research" to see if robots will be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accepted, but when I hear about preschoolers being apprehensive and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#then getting accustomed to it, I wonder how much of it is really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"make sure they will be accepted by introducing them young."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Sydney Morning Herald in *Australia* reports on this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and, as you can see above, Japan Today's English version reports\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on it. But I have not seen it in google news or any of my normal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#news sources, I found it from a blog link. I think that raises as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many questions in my mind as the story itself.
