I am not quite sure were to start or subdivide my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#posts right now, I have 3 articles, 2 from the New York\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Times, and one from the BBC, all dealing in one way or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#another with morality. "

"\>DNA Tells Students They Aren't Who They Thought" is a rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#silly article on the fact that the races are not all that clearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cut today. Based on cheek swab DNA tests, one class learned that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their racial identity, genetically speaking, is far less clear than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they thought. This really does not come as a huge surprise at all,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and is in fact a good thing. This really just follows from common\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sense, you have been seeing interracial children since Europeans\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and Africans for centuries now, you see it even in Shakespeare\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#("Othello"), and it surely must have been a reality of Roman times\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as well, there is nothing new under the sun. More recently, how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can you tell the stories of slave owners that our history books\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#glory in, depicting them at their worst, and not realize that our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"African Americans" are not all that purely "African" any more?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But however silly the article, it is good that such ideas are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#starting to permeate even the liberal consciousness, as it can only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#serve to blur the lines between the races, and racial equality will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only come with racial blindness. Why is it that color is more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than a descriptive? Only because we make it so, only because we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are not one culture, one people.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Next comes "

"\>Young Catholics Seek to Restore Old Values on Sex," the other\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#New York Times article. This one finds that many young people are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more theologically conservative than their parents were. It quickly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#backtracks, saying that not all young Catholics agree with our late\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pope, and that there is a similar swing towards social conservatism\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in young people of other denominations, but this does not negate the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#truth it first asserts. This almost brings me some home, that having\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#explored the limits, and the despair, of tolerance, we are perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#again learning that some things cannot and must not be tolerated.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It also notes in passing a key point, the parishes of the more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conservative priests are the ones that are growing most notably,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not the ones of the liberal priests the New York Times loves to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quote and hold up.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Last but hardly least, comes "[Prisoners\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#'aware' in executions](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4444473.stm)," which, I suspect, will begin the process\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by which yet another execution method will be declared "cruel and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unusual". Part of me is happy to see this; the part of me that would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#justify the means by the ends is happy to see another advance towards\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the end of the death penalty. Part of me is dismayed, how could\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we overlook such an obvious concern as making sure that the person\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was anesthetized? Part of me hopes that it will simply be modified,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not ruled unconstitutional: we have gone too far in declaring things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"cruel and unusual." The death penalty is neither cruel nor unusual,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is merely unnecessary and thus unjust. We are not called to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#usual path, but to the hard one. To approach the death penalty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in terms of "cruel and unusual" is to ignore the argument that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is simply inherently unjust no matter how it is done. It is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to ignore the right of the state to act to protect its citizens.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is to ignore the convict's value as a human life, intrinsic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#value, and argue alone on the quality of death. We are not, in so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#arguing, objecting to the death, but to the method of execution.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But the method itself is not what we truly quarrel with. Indeed,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#there is something to be said for the firing squad, it gave God a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#chance to act and preserve the life of the convict from the hands\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the state. There is something to be said for suffering, our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Lord suffered, and we are admonished by the example of the saints\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to join our suffering to His, for the greater glory of God. If the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#man must die, let us not quibble about how, so long as it is not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a truly horrific death, but if, as the Church argues, it is not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#necessary he must die, let us again, not quibble about how he does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#die, but work to end all unjust death. For as long as the death\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#penalty is an option, man will invent new ways by which to kill\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#each other to get around successive "cruel and unusual" findings.
