Some time ago,[1] Germany legalized prostitution. Apparently they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are not alone in doing so, Nevada and the Netherlands both also have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#legalized prostitution.[2] Sweden *did* but re-criminalized it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because legalizing it did not solve the problems proponents had hoped\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to solve (with legalization). No surprise there. Legalization also,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by and large, is not helping in Germany, and is still forcing some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women to choose between becoming a prostitute and being unemployed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#â€” and ineligible for Germany's unemployment aid. While I tend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to think that nationalized unemployment aid is beyond the scope of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just government, Germans are under such tax burdens that it would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not surprise me if there was no social infrastructure for aiding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people outside of the government assistance. This puts unemployed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women in an unacceptable position and accentuates the immorality\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of this tacit consent by the government on an immoral trade.
