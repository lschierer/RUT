The study[\^200709193] findings were released in book form, not in a journal. I suspect that means that its findings are useless and meaningless. Still, a pair of real researchers, working for institutions of higher learning (a college and a university respectively), found a 67% success rate in changing sexual orientation through a program of "group discussions, counseling, journal writing, Scripture reading and prayer."[\^200709194] \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#However, since it is not in a peer reviewed journal, their effort is wasted, their study might as well not exist.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200709193]: Mr. Stanton Jones and Mr. Mark Yarhouse. *Ex-Gays?
