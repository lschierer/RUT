You can sense how much some of the Church's hierarchy are hoping\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for a different pope in some of the anonymous comments in "[Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Breathing on Own Again; No Infection](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050225/D88FHNMO0.html)." It is not as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#overt as some articles are, thankfully, but it is still\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#really sad to hear about people hoping to capitalize on our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pope's death. The BBC has a slightly different article on this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Pope 'is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#breathing for himself'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4296537.stm)," which thinks there are "ethical problems\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as to whether and to what extent his life should be preserved by\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#artificial means."
