I cannot help but wonder if the fact that Sony has obtained a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#patent on "beam[ing] sensory perceptions, like sights, sounds, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#smells, directly into the brain" means it isn't quite so theoretical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as it is claimed to be. A number of articles deal with this, Ars [links\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to several](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050407-4785.html). This sort of thing really doesn't phase me anywhere\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#near as much the prospect of cyborgs, RFID tags, or biometrics do.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If it becomes realistic, economically feasible, and pervasive enough\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to cause an issue, someone will no doubt be smart enough to find\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a way to block it, and as ridiculous as tin foil caps may seem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to us today, I am sure society will adjust. After all, fashions\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from, for example, the 1600s seem rather nonsensical today also.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And along the same lines, no doubt many from the 1800s would consider\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us all slovenly.
