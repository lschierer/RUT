#+TITLE: A note for the CCD kids

Having been told that rap is 90% of the music out there, I wonder what my CCD kids last year would think of the rules at Ave Maria University.^[[1]](http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2006/aug/29/students_live_stricter_rules_catholic_school/?local_news\ "Students\ live\ by\ stricter\ rules\ at\ Catholic\ school")^ ;-) Not that I think there is much chance that many if any of them would choose to go to Ave Maria, but it would be â€¦ interesting to see their reaction to the policy.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
