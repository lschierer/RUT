As of the 28th, I will be working with CACI, the 25th is my last day with Accelerated. Let the countdown begin! I submitted my two weeks notice yesterday. While I felt some for Dan, as Eric submitted his the day before, the overwhelming emotion is excitement (about the new job) and relief (no more Danish days).
