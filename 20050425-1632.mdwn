Not to make light of the moral relativism pervading our society, but "[Let Cookie Monster be Cookie Monster](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jonahgoldberg/jg20050422.shtml)" has some good points. Why in the world is an accept or skin color part of identity but Cookie Monster having an insane craving for cookies not part of his? Conversely, why does Cookie Monster contribute to overweight kids, but the "Christian Right" (I would tend to debate that it is anywhere near that cohesive, but then I am a Catholic, and even though some people I know have seen far more of the abuse Protestants will dish out to Catholics, I am familiar enough with it to wonder at being lumped in with them) is making a big deal out of "nothing" when they worry about the over sexualization of television? Why is Sponge Bob not a big deal (regardless of the accuracy), but Cookie Monster is? ***Where in the world are our priorities here peopleâ€½***
