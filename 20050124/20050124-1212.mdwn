I think I have this all set up for now. No RSS, but that's fine with
me, if you've managed to find this, you are already coming here
periodically already. Maybe I'll do that later. It would be an
interesting exercise in php's xml capabilities to see if I can
generate something fairly compliant on the fly. Thanks to Joe Duffy,
who's LiveJournal gave me some ideas on how to format this.
