When I first heard that President Bush had proposed an income\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#indexed Social Security benefit, I knew that his "allies," the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#republican journalists, were going to savage him. And at least\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some of them have.[1] I, on the other hand, thought it brilliant,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and George Will seems to agree.[2]

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
First of all, it is nearly unattackable. This is doing exactly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what the indexed income taxes, so loved by the democrats, does,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it hurts the rich. Oh, it cuts into middle class benefits also,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an aspect I rather dislike, as it will impact me, and it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#particularly bad since we in the middle class pay the bulk of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#taxes to begin with, but for tax purposes we are rich, so why not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for Social Security? Oh, if only the liberals could be effectively\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#called on this oneâ€¦

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Secondly, as Mr. Will points out, as our most influential\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#citizens realize they do not need, and do not benefit from,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Social Security, there will begin to be some incentive to disband\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it entirely, eliminating one program the federal government has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no place administering. On the other hand, there will continue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be some incentive to expand it to "help" the richer citizens,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but that always exists, and we have resisted it fairly effectively\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in welfare.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
All of which demonstrates why the democrats are so opposed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to it, they cannot bear to see this leash around our collective\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#necks loosened. They would have us dependent on the government for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#everything, so that they can use the threat of cut benefits to enact\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#whatever social policies they see fit to propose. They would leave\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us trapped in a fairly classic trap between a carrot and a whip.
