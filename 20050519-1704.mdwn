Eric Warmenhoven is apparently annoyed by the oft-repeated\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#statement that "everything happens for a reason."[1] People who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#state this typically mean that God's plans are often not evident\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to human perception, and that time will show the good that will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#come of some event. This represents a crucial mistake.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Eric is absolutely right, the statement as it stands, is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#horrid misunderstanding of cause and effect. Even if you properly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#take into account the concept of free will, a given event happened\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*because* of some past event. That is to say, it was caused\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by that past event or choice. The actual teaching is that God\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will bring good out of everything, even out of evil. This is only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#superficially the same as the preceding, erroneous, statement.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
In bringing good out of evil, God is not, usually, side-stepping\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#causality (though He can). Joan of Arc's preservation of France\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was not miraculous (well, perhaps it was, but it was not miraculous\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the sense that it happened after the need for it). Rather, all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is necessary is to realize that from her choices and actions,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#God inspired certainly, but still rooted in causality, we later\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#came to a situation where Catholic France would not be brought down\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when England betrayed the Faith in the Protestant Reformation.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Again, the two statements, even with this example, remain very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#very similar. Someone in between St. Joan and the Reformation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would know the *reason* for France's freedom: St. Joan acted.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They would not however know the *purpose* for her actions.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Specifically, they could guess *her* purposes for acting,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but not *God's* for inspiring and aiding her actions. It is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the *purpose* that will come clear with time, the purpose\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for which God did allow it, or the purpose for which He will use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it, or both. *It* will be used as a cause, and the things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*it will cause* remain unknown.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
In some sense, this really is the same as saying the reason is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unknown, but only if you think, as Calvin taught, that everything\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is predestined. It is not. You did not get sick *because*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you needed to suffer. Adam did not sin *because* Jesus\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would save us. Rather, Jesus saved us because Adam sinned. Adam is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the reason, or cause, of Jesus' coming, Jesus is not the reason,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or cause, of Adam's sin. Now everything is as clear as mud. â˜º
