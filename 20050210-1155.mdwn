Okay, so I was mistaken about there not being anything particularly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#note worthy today. While not hugely significant, I realized as I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was inserting this into the previous post that I have more to say\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than I'd initially thought, and thus that it should be in its own\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#post so that I can cleanly refer back to it if I want to.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Dozens\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Episcopalians Follow Leader into Catholic Church](http://www.ncregister.com/current/0206lead1.htm)" and "[Married\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Priests? The English Experience](http://www.ncregister.com/current/0206lead2.htm)" are a pair of articles\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from the [National\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholic Register](http://www.ncregister.com) on married priests in the western or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Much food for thought, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can't quite make out where the first article is coming from,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the second one I think the author is reluctantly coming down\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against it. This is one of the more controversial topics in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Church right now, and it kind of relates to Ederlyn's "[Attempted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#virtue is its own punishment, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#think.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/baranoouji/186084.html)." Specifically she links to "[What\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Is the Vatican Saying About Women?](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64112-2004Aug13.html)" which is an odd\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#run down of some of the things the Vatican is currently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#saying about women. I have no clue how accurate it is,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so I'll take it at its word for the most part for now.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But towards the end I do take issue with it, and thus with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the one line of comments on Ederlyn's post. There seems to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a prevailing thought that Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter, "[Ordinatio\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Sacerdotalis](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html)," is not in fact the final word on the subject of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the ordination of women, but is only the final word of Pope John Paul\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#II's pontificate. I suppose people either have trouble grasping\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the idea of infallibility, which I could sympathize with, or they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#find the language at the end of the letter to be less than the bar\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for infallibility to be invoked. I'm really rather curious which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is the case, but not sufficiently so to come out and ask directly.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It seems rather to make the doctrine meaningless to require more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than he has said:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#regarding a matter of great importance, a matter which pertains to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Church's divine constitution itself, in virtue of my ministry of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#confirming the brethren (cf. Lk 22:32) I declare that the Church has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#faithful.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And I know that there is a tendency to raise the bar so high it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot be met, in part because of our own unwillingness to accept\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it, and in part to make reconciliation with the protestants easier.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For they should have no trouble accepting a doctrine that in practice\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#never comes into play. And how much easier it would be to invent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our own morality, to decide for ourselves what is right and wrong,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#acceptable and unacceptable, possible and impossible, if there is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no one who can absolutely say "this is what is." Not that I think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#such thoughts are in the forefront of people's minds when they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ignore infallibility or make it impossible to invoke, I doubt they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are consciously denying the existence of absolute right and wrong\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at all. Rather, I would tend to think they are simply subconsciously\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#denying their *own* error, and thus if they are not in error,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the contradicting statement must be.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#All of this most likely sounds incredibly haughty on my part, as if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I were full of myself and my own correctness. I do not, however,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mean to sound that way. Perhaps it is I who am wrong, and the bar to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#infallibility really does require more. If so, I'd question why our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Holy Father worded his statement the way he did, but there could be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other reasons for having done so. Perhaps the Holy Spirit intervened\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so far and no further, a just-enough intervention. It is certainly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one conceivable explanation. Perhaps it is a bad translation,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or my own misuse of language that leads me to read an absolute\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#meant as such in that paragraph. I do not think so, but I accept\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the possibility, and if you want to argue otherwise, I'd be curious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to hear your rationale (so long as it ***is***\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rational ;-). I promise to try my best not to bite your head off\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if you, whoever you are reading this, choose to email me over it.
