Robots reproduce![1] This would likely be useful, it should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#eventually lead to robots that can self-repair, and, as it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is miniaturized, to specialty robots that build other things.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Think *Diamond Age*. On the other hand, it still tends\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#towards my overall worry that several hundred years from now, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will think that robots evolved. I would like to think there will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#continue to be a clear distinction between life and its simulation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(robots, AI, both). I worry that might cease to be.
