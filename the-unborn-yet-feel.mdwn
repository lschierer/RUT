#+TITLE: The unborn yet feel

Between 20 and 25 weeks of age, or somewhere after 5 months, a baby, not yet born mind you, can feel pain, feel, hear, and see.^[[1]](http://www.zenit.org/english/show_14.php)^ The senses are apparently developed in that order, coming into existence progressively, and documented both by studies of premature babies and of those still in the womb. And yet such children remain at risk of being killed by abortion.
