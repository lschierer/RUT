In looking at the Freedom of Religion:  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Judge\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#drops all charges against Philly Christians](http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42905)" restores some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#semblance of sanity, this judge saw through the legal antics of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#those who would silence Christians. It is a rare piece of good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#news.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Impeach\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Judge Napoleon Jones!](http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38074)" is on a nearly opposite note. This\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#activist judge is on a crusade to remove the Boy Scouts from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#public life over which he presides. The ACLU is eager to help\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#him, with their well demonstrated hatred of all things Christian.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Apparently ***city*** governments cannot\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#form partnerships with the Boy Scouts to fund and maintain public\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#parks.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[City\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#appeals Commandments removal](http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37109)" is not primarily about that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#judge in Mississippi, as you might expect. Rather, it appears a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#similar thing is happening in Wisconsin. The local government there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#took what seems to me an unusual step in avoiding the necessity\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of removing the monument: it sold the monument and the land to a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#non-profit. Apparently even though this has worked in other cases,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is again being challenged. Good luck to those fighting to keep\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#awareness of our Christian heritage alive.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is part of a disturbing trend that [David Limbaugh](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/) has spent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#considerable time documenting. There are consistent efforts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to broaden the "Wall of Separation" that Jefferson wrote of.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Somewhere recently I read about when this became precedent in the US\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Supreme Court, I am going to have to find that article again. Ah,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this is a reminder of why I set this log up, the article in question\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is in my log, on [Friday,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#18th of February 2005](./view.php?date=20050218-1203). And surprise surprise, the ACLU was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#involved in removing religion from the public sphere here also! [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.catholicherald.com/articles/05articles/separation.htm) is a must read, I find myself wanting to quote nearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all of it.
