Mr. Jeff Jacoby is an idealist. He thinks that the states might\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be persuaded to give up their right to indoctrinate the majority\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of children for the first thirteen years of their education.[1] He\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is absolutely right, the public school model is not the only model\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that would ensure the education of our children. If we privatized\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the public school systems and repealed the taxes that pay for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them (primarily the property tax), we would all have enough money\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to pay for their schooling. If someone worries that this might\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not be enough, we can provide further tax credits for it as well.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And of course religious schools *could* provide scholarships,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and so on.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Further, the public schools currently get several times the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#amount of money per student that the Catholic schools do, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yet no one can seriously say that the Catholic school systems do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worse at providing education. In fact, many parents say they do a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*better* job. This leads to an interesting line of thought:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where does all that extra money go? Well, some of it goes to higher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#salaries for teachers, the fact that you take a pay cut choosing to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#work in a Catholic school is well known. But some of it also goes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the higher levels of beurocracy in the public school system,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the teachers' union, so on. All fat that could be cut from their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#budget to make the schools more competative. This is the sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thing that has led to the success of so called "charter schools"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in some school districts, where a private firm gets a contract to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#run a school as long as they can improve the results the school\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#gets on the SOLs (I might be somewhat inacurate here defining\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#charter schools. I do not know too much about them).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Another important point to remember is that universal public\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#schooling is a relatively recent invention. One of the reasons\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that you see the use of public funds to provide bus service to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholic schools in some north eastern states is because these\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#schools *were* the "public" school system for a long time,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#until the states had the political preasure to build their own.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In the South on the other hand, you did not see this development\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of schools. The richer families home schooled, and the poorer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simply did not learn much. As a result you had the rise of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#white cracker subculture in the south, that closely mirrors the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#black culture today[2]. Going into the Civil War then, you see\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the illiteracy rate in the south was very high, much higher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than in the north, though neither had what we would understand\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#today as public schooling.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But the failure of the south to educate really does not argue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for the existance of public schooling. Rather, it speaks to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simple fact that education was widely believed to be unnecessary\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the society constructed in the south. The sustinence farmers\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#certainly did not need it, and the plantations needed only a few\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who could read and write. Similarly, in the small town, one's word\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was either good or not, reguardless of the form an agreement took,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and everyone knew it.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
On the other hand, the failure of the public school system\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*to* adequately educate *is* pertinent. Illiteracy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is still higher than it should be, especially amoung inner city\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#students. Even where literacy exists, understanding of history,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#math, and science often lags. Critical thinking is nearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#universally unknonw. We have gone from a culture that nearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#requires a highschool diploma to succeed, to one that nearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#requires a college dilopma to succeed. From men being ready to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#take on responsibility at 18 and 20, to men still in some sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#extended adolecence nearly till 30, assuming they ever grow up and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#embrase responsibility. Clearly we are failing. It should then\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be just as clear that the system does not work, and simply throwing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more money at it, to do the same thing, will not work.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Still, common sense tells us that this will not happen.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The teachers' union is one of the more effective lobbying efforts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the left, and it would be political suicide to try to privatize\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#education. Further, even were a state to try to do so, the federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#laws would likely "preempt" and require state spending on it anyway.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The political cost then, in terms of careers burned, for something\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with no grassroots preasure, is prohibitively high, and this post,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like Mr. Jacoby's column, is very nearly a waste of space.
