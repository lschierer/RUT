I am rather surprised to note that I apparently did\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*not* make significant note of Rebecca Hagelin's "[Jailhouse\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Middle School](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/rebeccahagelin/rh20050225.shtml)." I certainly read it, and it certainly doesn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#come as much surprise, but rather just an unneeded confirmation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of what I know goes on. Perhaps that's why I didn't comment\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on it. It certainly isn't exactly "safe" for me to do so,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as a guy, I'm not allowed to comment on girls, how they act\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or what they wear. Unless I am complimenting them of course.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#See [my previous post\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#today](./view.php?date=20050307-1448) for a little more on this theme. Anyway, while\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am skating on thin ice, I am going to go ahead and crash\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on through. Ms. Hagelin's (I am really not sure, is she a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mrs or not? I hope so, she has children.) more recent article, "[Parents:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it's time to step up](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/rebeccahagelin/rh20050304.shtml)," improves on the original. It introduces\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the theme of parental responsibility! The idea that parents should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*parent*. Wow! What an original concept!

> How? Because their parents let them. And because many of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#schools have given up - administrators are just too tired, or too\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lazy, or too liberal to care anymore. Moms and dads, administrators\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and teachers, it's our fault if America's little girls look like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a tramps.

> Face the facts: Most 12 - 16 year olds don't have access to a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lot of cash - unless, of course, their parents give it to them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And, last I heard, if you're below the age of 16 you simply can't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hop in a car and drive yourself to the local mall. Nope, it's not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the kids' money that is being spent, it's the parents' money. And\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it's usually the mom that happily drives the little darlings to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the mall for a fun day of shopping. Face it: Little girls dress\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#according to what their mommies allow.

What chance\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does a little girl stand of keeping her childhood or innocence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#intact when it's mommy that's driving her to the store and paying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for the thongs, the itty-bitty skirts, the hipster jeans and the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#plunging necklines?
