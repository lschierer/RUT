When I took Mason's class on the philosophy of the natural\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sciences, I was introduced to David Hume's ideas for substantially\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the first time. For those who are even less familiar with him\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than I, he rejected deduction as a from of knowing. Just because\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#dropping a pencil has resulted in it falling to the ground fifteen\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#zillion times, he said, you cannot know that it will do so the next.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I, in my simplicity and ignorance, rejected this. Common sense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tells me that deduction is valid, that I do know that the pencil\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will fall.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Lately I have been reading *Galileo's Mistake*, by Wade\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Rowland, which Ederlyn and Joe gave me for Christmas. This wonderful\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#look at that sad time in our Church's history provides me with the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#justification for my dismissal of Hume. Strictly speaking, he is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#absolutely right. For both the scientific realist and the Catholic,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the value of deduction comes as an article of faith. For the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#scientific realist, or empiricist, it is faith in the rationality of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the world, and, secondly, in the reality of math-based explanations\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of that world. Neither of those are, strictly speaking, provable.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#You cannot demonstrate in sound logic that our theories do in fact\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#describe anything real. You can only, accurately, assert that they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are useful. The pragmatist is satisfied with this (as I am not a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#philosopher, my use of all of these terms overlaps some naturally).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For the Catholic, it follows that the God who gave us our minds\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#intended us to use them to learn of Him through His works.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It follows that God, Who is Truth, would not create a world to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#deceive us. For both then, science is *a* path to knowledge;\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for the scientific rationalist, the only path. The difference\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is that while the scientific rationalist *professes* that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#science produces no laws, only theories, the Catholic actually\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#believes that. And understands that he can rarely know, without\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#God's aid, what the actual reality is. A practical example is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Newton's Laws of Motion. They are not really laws. They are not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even really true. General Relativity does not augment them, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#replaces them. General Relativity is not more simple, it is more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#complex, you cannot teach it to the high school student the way\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you can Newton's Laws. But Newton's Laws do not describe reality,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they just happen to be useful, to provide sufficiently accurate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#results, in many day to day, real life situations. Thus science,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which would have said it knew the reality of the universe before\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#discovering that Newton must be at least partially wrong, is not and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot be the final arbiter of what *is*. It does not know,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it merely knows that this or that math equation "saves the facts"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(using an ancient phrase), that is, it provides a useful and adequate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#explanation for the set of facts they wish to explain (or it does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not, but it comes closer than any other, reference the struggle\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics). What science does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#give us is *models* of how things *might* work, that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#provide more or less useful results, but for all we can verify them,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*have no relationship to reality*. What then *does*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#provide certainty about reality? What grounds our observation, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lets us find fact with it? It is our faith, our faith in the Church,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in God, in His love for us in furtherance of which He has made an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#orderly existence that we might learn to know Him from His work.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#An existence whose design cries out that it must have been created\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by its precision, the incredible odds against our being here to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#observe it.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
On a side note, this would also explain the incredible energy and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#success of science since the protestant reformation. Lacking any\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#base, any certainty, science has searched unceasingly for a theory\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about which it could say "Yes! We can now explain everything,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because man is not built for the uncertainty in which they have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#left us. The need to make sense, to find order in the apparent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#chaos drives men forward down whatever path they think left to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them, seeking for what God alone could provide. Perhaps this has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#benefited us as society, but I wonder at the tally sheet. We have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more time saving devices, but less free time for friends and family.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Longer lives, but still death comes too soon, finds us with things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unfinished, undone. We suffer less from disease, but more from moral\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decay. At what cost our "progress"? Mind you, I have no answers.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The life of the Middle Ages was no picnic, I would not go back to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that time. I would not go back to the fear of loosing the wife I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#may someday have with each child God might choose to bless us with.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Of loosing my life, the lives of children I may have, in wars closer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to home than those we have today. Of seeing the devastation wrought\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by plague. Selfish of me, when war is on the front door step of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many in our world, when things like AIDS ravishes a continent,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but such is life, such am I.
