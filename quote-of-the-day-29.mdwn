> UN agencies constantly use the number 500,000+ as the number of women worldwide who die each year from complications from pregnancy. They go on to use that number as a reason for abortion to be legalized. The problem is the number cannot be substantiated since most countries do not report data on deaths at all let alone deaths from maternal causes. Even these UN agencies admit that mortality figures are almost universally unavailable yet they insist on using this phony number.[\^200711011]
