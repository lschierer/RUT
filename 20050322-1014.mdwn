Judge James D. Whittemore of Federal District Court in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Tampa Florida refused to order Mrs. Schiavo's feeding tube.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He thinks that the parents did not, perhaps could not,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#prove a significant likelihood of wining further court\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#battles, a likelihood they apparently have to prove to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get a temporary order from the Judge. I am mostly seeing [this](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050322/D8902I400.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#AP News article linked to,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#perhaps because it does not require registration. [This](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/national/22cnd-schiavo.html?ei=5088&en=7a3189f284e34074&ex=1269147600&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#NY Times article has the most details\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the federal court's decision though, and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A55137-2005Mar21?language=printer)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Washington Post article has more background on why she is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#said to be in a "persistent vegetative state." I cannot help\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but note that the details in the Post article are rather more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#restricted than the details in the lawyer's writeup that I linked\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to [yesterday](./view.php?date=20050321-1431).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Post describes her interaction as being restricted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to facial expression, but the lawyer has her responding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#audibly if not really intelligibly as well. I also rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#question the use of the person's ability to track visually\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and respond to commands as the sole criteria of consciousness,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#especially after having read Mr. Chuck Colson's article, posted [here](./view.php?date=20050316-1004). Michelle Malkin [continues](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001825.htm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to track this, and her sources do not rate the odds of success very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#highly. â˜¹
