#+TITLE: Justice Sandra Day O'Conner Retires

I heard from a debian developer's web log that Justice Sandra Day O'Conner has announced her retirement.[[1]](http://adam.rosi-kessel.org/weblog/the_law/oconnor_resigning.html) The BBC simply lists her as a Justice who has often cast the deciding vote in cases,[[2]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4642059.stm) while CNN goes a little further, making clear that she is significant in the decisions related to elections and, far more importantly, abortion.[[3]](http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/01/oconnor.resigns.ap/index.html).

I ***hope*** that President Bush nominates a good originalist, not someone like Attorney General Gonzales. We need someone who will help put a halt to the judicial tyranny that we are currently living under, where the nine men and women of the Supreme Court effectively legislating from the bench.

**Update 20050701-1122:** Mrs. Michelle Malkin apparently agrees with my take that Mr. Gonzales would be a poor choice.
