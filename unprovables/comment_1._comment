<p>Gödel's theorems do not relate to the unprovability of a formal system's axioms.  The observation that you have to have certain statements that define the system you are reasoning about is not particularly profound and hardly merits a theorem stating it.  The thing to bear in mind is that in any interesting formal system these axioms are just definitions of the concepts we will be reasoning about.  Thus, the Peano axioms give you things like the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties that define what it means for two numbers to be "equal".</p>

<p>Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem, on the other hand states that for any sufficiently powerful formal system (i.e., powerful enough to describe the standard laws of arithmetic) there are statements that are true within that system, but which are not provable as theorems.  There is also a Second Incompleteness Theorem that states that any formal system that can prove its own consistency is perforce inconsistent.  These theorems place fundamental limits on the power of formal systems, inasmuch as they assert that no formal system can capture every true statement about its domain of applicability.</p>

<p>If you really want to learn about the Incompleteness Theorems, you can hardly do better than Douglas Hofstadter's book "Gödel, Escher, Bach".  It has excellent descriptions of the theorems and their proofs and is very accessible to non-mathematicians.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
