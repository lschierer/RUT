Okay, yes, I am vain, but this week's Debian Weekly News email\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just made my day.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> Debian-Volatile Strategy. The volatile team\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[29]pondered to create a second [30]volatile archive with less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#strict criteria. This would help packages such as [31]Gaim that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#need to be updated during the lifetime of sarge in order to support\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#modified protocols. They are also looking for ways to announce\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#updated packages.

I talked to some of the \#Debian-release guys about this late\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#last week, when I learned that we would not be able to back port\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some rather trivial bug fixes to Debian's 1.2.1 Gaim package with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#any significant chance of getting them accepted. If we cannot get\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#trivial bug fixes in, how in the world would we ever get the kind\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of significant changes that a new authentication for a protocol\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would cause? I would rather avoid a situation like the current\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Debian stable, which has a 0.58 that will not work with many of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the protocols it claims to support.

It is nice to be listened to.
