A few days ago I mentioned the comments made by one of the bands that was at the time scheduled to play at World Youth Day this year.[[1]](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050804-1505/womens-ordination-and-society) Today I learn that their performance has been canceled.[[2]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4591) I also learn that the band is apparently protestant and their performance scheduled as an ecumenical event. While that somewhat explains their views, I am not sorry to see their invitation revoked.
