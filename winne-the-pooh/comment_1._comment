<p>Wow, this sounds about right!  How funny!
Do you read these comments?  If you do, I hope you will remember me - Suzy from CCM.  Do you?  I'm so excited to see you're married now! Congrats!  Ok, so this isn't so much a comment on the Winnie-the-Pooh quiz as it is a How are you after all these years? thing.  Anyways, I hope you are well, if you want you can e-mail me at dandylionz@hotmail.com.  God bless you, Luke!</p>
