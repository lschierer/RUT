We have a Pope!!

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The College of Cardinals has elected Benedict XVI,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#formerly Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as pope. If you have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been hiding under a rock somewhere and have not heard\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this name, Vincas points out that Wikipedia already has
a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope\_Benedict\_XVI"quite\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a collection of facts about him. My prayers are with our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#new pope.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
I suspect that things will not be easy for him, he is going to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#face quite a bit of dislike from the people who insist on believing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that any pope could or would change the Church's teaching on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexual "marriage," women in the clergy, divorce, or a host of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other issues. But then, I think that any pope would have to face\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that, not just one starting his pontificate with a well established\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#history of theological orthodoxy.
