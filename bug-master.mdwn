For the first time ever, a good description of what I do in gaim: [Bug Master](http://tieguy.org/talks/why%20everyone%20needs%20a%20bugmaster.txt "why everyone needs a bugmaster"). Mr. Luis Villa nicely describes what a "Bug Master" is and is not, in a way that closely mirrors my own work, and why that role is important both in open source and in the commercial software world. This is nice to see, and I am very thankful to faceprint for passing it on.
