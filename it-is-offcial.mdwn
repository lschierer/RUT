Lauren, the most wonderful girl in the world, is no longer my girlfriend: she is now my fianc√©e!!!!\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#**update 2006-08-28 1904 EDT** Some pictures are up [here](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/photos/engagement/engagement.html). None of the ring yet, as we were using Lauren's camera, and she prefers not to be in pictures. As a result, many of the ones she took remain on my computer, but not up on the website. I see little point in pictures of me, no one but Lauren wants to look at them anyway. ;-)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#**update 2006-08-28 2053 EDT** On second thought, I posted all of them. It was easier to do that after Lauren sent me the 3 of the ring, than to pick and choose again, esp. as she wanted me to set up a site with pictures with french labels for her grandmother.
