#+TITLE: The State Department has some guts

The State Department appears to have found the guts to stop funding a United Nations program that effectively supports China's one child policies.^[[1]](http://www.thefactis.org/default.aspx?control=ArticleMaster&aid=243&authid=11)^ Surprisingly, this is not the first year they have done so. Less surprisingly, but incredibly depressingly, this step is apparently necessary because no one else will recognize the fact that China is killing babies, and interfering with the choices that married couples make left and right.
