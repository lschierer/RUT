In yet another example of scientists realizing that their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#models have left significant events out of the equation, "[Sun's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Temper Blamed for Arctic Ozone Loss](http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050301_ozone_thinning.html)" talks about the unexpected\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nature of the Arctic ozone loss this year. Apparently we didn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expect the Sun to play a role. Will they revise the Antarctic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#models because of this? Perhaps CFCs are not as significant as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#previously thought?
