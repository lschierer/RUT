Apparently Weyco is not alone in banning employees from smoking,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not just at work, but at all.[1] Larry Elder also moves towards the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#humorous in comparing some of the statistics about smokers to some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of those about democrats. The one example that struck me was the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#banning of smokers, not because of the health risks and related\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expenses to the employer, but because of the *image* that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#smokers have. Wow!, and here I thought that Weyco was extreme!
