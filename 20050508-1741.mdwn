I find today that schools are increasingly using computer programs\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to grade writing assignments.[1] While this would be awesome\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if they could get it to work reliably, I fear that like the one\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#student quoted states, all that students will really learn is how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to beat the system. Natural language parsers are a notoriously hard\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#problem to solve, and key word searches are incredibly difficult to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get working well. While much progress has been made, look at the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#evolution of search engines, some of this has been done by avoiding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the problem entirely, google's page rank for instance, specifically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#avoids part of the natural language problem by categorizing its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#keyword search by the page rank, essentially trusting the collective\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#judgment of real humans. Grading an essay is rather more complex\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than the incredibly simplistic form of data mining involved in a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#search engine. The computer-grader needs to not only detect the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*presence* of certain key words, but needs to determine if a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#correct relationship has been demonstrated between them, in any of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the various ways a student could word it. Grammar checking is fairly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#straight forward, but even the best spelling dictionaries we have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#available to date do not contain a full set of English, including\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the jargon specific to the various fields that the high school and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#college student will need. However, while I maintain that grammar\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is "fairly straight forward," it is never the less a significantly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#difficult problem that it is not unheard of for a human writer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to disagree with them various grammatics *and be right*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Thus overall, while I hold hope that this sort of grading might at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some point be feasible, and, to the extent that it is achieved,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does provide a useful service in removing some of the repetition\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and drudgery of teaching, I maintain that it is likely a mistake\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to deploy it in any sort of unverified (by which I mean a real live\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#human verifies it came up with a reasonable result) manner.
