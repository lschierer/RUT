\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Apparently Fillmore Central High School's administrators feel quite strongly about abortion.^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5725\ "Federal\ judge\ rules\ school\ cannot\ bar\ student\ from\ wearing\ pro-life\ shirt")^ So much so, that a pro-life shirt is unacceptably offensive, but all sorts of shirts that would be offensive to a Catholic are just fine.

Fortunately, there are groups out there to help those caught in such predicaments, and this time at least the good guys won. â˜º
