<p>Hay cousin, this is Oregon it is neat that you are in print, I am glad you liked the picnic basket. Do you have an e-mail I can send christmas letters to. I have not had the opportunity to see what you wrote, I still am at the walking stage on MacBook. You can still have windows on mac with Fusion. Did that for my mother in law. Elaine</p>
