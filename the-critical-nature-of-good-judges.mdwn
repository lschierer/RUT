#+TITLE: The critical nature of good judges

For once Mr. Pat Buchanan has posted an editorial I agree with. Though somewhat disingenuous, blaming the Warren court for every poor Supreme Court decision since, he accurately summarizes what these outrages have been.[[1]](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=45139) Like him, I wonder if President Bush understands just how critical it is that he nominate good judges who will follow the constitution rather than attempting to write law, and who will have the courage and moral fortitude to overturn the bad decisions of the past.
