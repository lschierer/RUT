Some authors go so far as to say without\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#visible, or nearly without visible movement. This is significant\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in light of the [fact that it is apparently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#possible](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7247). As this is the result of military research, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would tend to assume that this means there are now smaller and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#better versions available to the military than are discussed in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the article.
