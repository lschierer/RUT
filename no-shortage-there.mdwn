It is interesting to note that Lincoln, Nebraska, perhaps the country's most theologically conservative diocese, does not appear to be suffering from the general shortage of priests across the rest of the country.^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5252\ "Priestly\ shortage?\ Not\ in\ Lincoln")^ As the article states, this is probably not a function of conservatism *per se*, but of correct teaching; the two just happen to be similar at this moment in history. Still, it is something for those who say that the Church is "behind the times" and needs to catch up to look at.
