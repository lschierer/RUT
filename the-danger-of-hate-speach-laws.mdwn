#+TITLE: The Danger of Hate Speach Laws

In today's news, someone else has realized the potential for some of our current laws to be used as a weapon against the Church.[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4264) Currently, if a priest in his homily says something that is taken as an endorsement of a particular candidate, he risks loss of tax exempt status for the parish. Clearly this restricts the expression of any religion that teaches its members to make political decisions informed by their professed morality. Along the same lines, if it becomes "hate speech" to declare that homosexual "marriage" is wrong, then it will clearly be a restriction on a priest's ability to instruct his congregation without risk of arrest.
