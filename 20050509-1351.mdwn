Most people will not question the idea that black families earn\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less, on average, than white ones. Democrats use this to advance\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the idea that discrimination still exists. Star Parker, herself a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#black woman (to defuse the idea that I am coming up with these ideas\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all on my own), proposes some alternative reasons why this might\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be.[1] A much higher percentage of broken families, and a higher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#percentage of AIDS (which is a behavioral disease remember, you have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be promiscuous or drug using to get it) go a long way to explain\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#things, *if* you happen to believe, as I do, that the family\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is the basic building block of a stable and prosperous society.
