Everyone with any sense knows that the Constitution says nothing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about funding the National Institutes of Health, the Department of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, Social Security,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Medicare/Medicaid, so on. The Federal Government is, by any sane\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reading of the constitution (I.E. not insanely extending "necessary\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and proper"), incredibly limited in scope. So since the electorate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#demonstrably does not care, why does Terence Jeffrey think that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#merely pointing the fact of unconstitutional spending once again\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will get anyone upset, inform anyone of anything new, or otherwise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be worth writing?[1]
