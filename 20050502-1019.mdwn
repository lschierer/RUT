Kansas [just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#barely fails](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-29-2005/555f0019b6068ea9.html) to override a veto on a bill to require abortion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#clinics get an annual license. Apparently its too much to ask that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they be (relatively) clean and safe (for the mother, its a given\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the child will be killed).

Thursday on my interminable drive home, Sean Hannity\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#said that he thinks that the mental inhibition against\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#harming a child, once crossed, is something that dehumanizes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the person. I cannot help but think of that as I see [a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mother charged with killing her children](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-29-2005/221b000dd5e4ea54.html). What is wrong with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our society that this is not even the first time this sort of charge\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has been made in recent memory?
