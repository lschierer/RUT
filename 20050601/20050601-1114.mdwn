What will it take to drive it home to society that men and
women are different, and that these differences cannot be ignored?
The rising divorce rates have not done it, the ever more evident
cost of delaying the decision to have a family has not done it.
The ever more evident cost of day care and latch-key children has
not done it.  What will?

It will obviously take a significant change in mindset.
Women will have to embrace their femininity, it cannot be forced
on them.  Perhaps, though I pray not, we will see women in combat,
as Ms. Martha Kleder fears we are coming ever closer to seeing,
with all the added horrors and added risks that will entail.[^1]
I pray it never comes to pass.  I fear it is inevitable.  I wonder
though, will that be sufficient to wake us up?  Or will
it make things even worse?  Will it desensitize us even further to
the problems that our refusal to admit reality has brought us to?
