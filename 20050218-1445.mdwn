Michelle Malkin is correct, "[Texan\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#arrested; said he was after bin Laden bounty](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3046178)" is simply downright\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#weird. If the guy is telling the truth, what in the world was he\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thinking? And what's up with the FBI simply assuming he is lying?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If he's serious, he isn't unreasonably equipped, though he sands\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no chance at success for all that. If he is lying, then you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*really* want to ask what in the world was he thinking?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Did he really think they would buy that excuse? Either way here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we have lots of issues.
