In science news today, "[\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Quantum Wires](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/feature_emerging.asp?p=2)" talks about using nanotubes for wires.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It says that if they can get macroscopic wires of just one type\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of nanotube, they will be able to do superconducting without the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cooling. Right now when they make macroscopic wires they end up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with all sorts of nanotubes.

In other news, I finally finished *Galileo's Mistake*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Really, I finished it last week, as I had all of a page left to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#read at lunch today. If I'd realized, as I should have, that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rest of the book was just index, I would have taken the extra\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#minute to finish it then. It is a very good book, and I highly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#recommend it.
