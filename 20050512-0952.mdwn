It is hard to believe the level of arrogance when, right after\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#discovering a new species, scientists are talking about how this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#might be the last such discovery ever.[1] As if they would not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have said a month ago that they would never make such a discovery!\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Rather than realizing how little they know, they insist this is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a fluke, they cannot allow there to be even the smallest chink in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their claims of having all the answers. At least, until the next\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time the rain forest is threatened, then they will remember that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#there are things out there they have not discovered yet. ;-)
