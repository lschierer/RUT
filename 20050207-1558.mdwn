Democrats are all about saying how there is money\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the trust fund to last far longer than President\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Bush's projections. David Frum refutes this in a way\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that even I can be reliably trusted to repeat. He [writes](http://www.nationalreview.com/frum/diary020605.asp#055438)  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> If you or I held hundreds of billions of dollars of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Treasury bills, we'd think ourselves pretty comfortably provided for.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So if T-bills are good enough for Bill Gates and the Bank of Japan,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#why aren't they good enough to secure the future of America's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#retirees?  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#NRO readers, being a sophisticated bunch, have probably already\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#spotted the fallacy here. If Fred writes an IOU for $10 to Jim,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Jim has an asset. But if Fred writes an IOU to Fred for $10,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he has not created an asset for himself â€” he's created a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reminder notice.  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And that's the situation of the Trust Fund.  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#One branch of the US government (the Treasury) owes another branch\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(the Trust Fund) a bunch of money. The question is not whether\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#those IOUs are legally binding. Of course they are. The question\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is: Does the existence of those IOUs in any way make it easier for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the US government to pay Social Security benefits? And the answer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to that is of course not.  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That's why the crucial fact about Social Security is not the legal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#question of how many bonds it has. The crucial fact about Social\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Security is the economic question: When will the demands on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#system exceed the system's revenues? Currently, the crossover\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#point is estimated to be thirteen years from now.
