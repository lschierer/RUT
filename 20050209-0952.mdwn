2 small steps forward today on the pro-life front. "[Embryo\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ruling Could Have Ripple Effect](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1500/2-8-2005/20050208134509_28.html)" is an interesting case in which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an Illinois couple has sued a fertility clinic for allowing an embryo\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they hoped would become their child to die. This is only a small\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#step because the article claims there is a significant chance this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#case will not hold up on appeal. Hopefully the fact of the case\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#itself will hold up, as even that is up for appeal in this case\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#apparently, as there is some question as to the applicability\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the Illinois law in question. The second item is "[Va.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#House OKs Gay Marriage Amendment Ban](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-8-2005/20050208140004_25.html)," apparently this must be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#voted on once again after an election, and then goes to a referendum.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This long process still ahead, at least 3 more votes, one of which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is by the populace at large, is why I consider this a small step.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, it passed both House and Senate by significant margins, so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#there is reason to hope. Yesterday I encountered disagreement on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this issue that I wasn't expecting. Sean believes that the state\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#governments do not have any business regulating what is or is not a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#marriage, and thus have no business denying gay "marriage" requests.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#To my thinking the role of the state is to recognize what exists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#independently of the state, with our without their recognition,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and to add the support of the civil governance to the new couple in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#addition to the support of the community. Thus, a man cannot truly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#marry a man, nor a woman truly marry a woman, it becomes tautological\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the state cannot and must not recognize such a "marriage."
