I was going to try to avoid repeating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what you could read everywhere else today, so I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wasn't going to post anything about Mrs. Schiavo.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But then I read two townhall.com articles in a row, "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#great quandary](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/wfbuckley/wfb20050322.shtml)," by William F. Buckley, and "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#right to kill Terri Schiavo](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/maggiegallagher/mg20050322.shtml)," by Maggie Gallagher. Mr. Buckley\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is defending the rule of law, and our judicial process. He accepts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the court saw accurate, unbiased testimony on Mrs. Schiavo's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#state, that she is in fact in a "persistent vegetative state."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He compares this to the Elian Gonzalez mess a few years ago.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ms. Gallagher, on the other hand, questions that testimony.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#She believes the neurologist who disputes it, the testimony of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her mother, father, brother,s and sisters. She realizes that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Schiavo's reduced moral authority *should* equate to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reduced legal authority; something that Mr. Buckley apparently does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not realize. She references the report that Mrs. Schiavo can swallow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her own siliva, has swallowed some pudding on occasion, and could,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with therapy, learn to swallow enough to not need a feeding tube.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Therapy that her husband, despite Mr. Buckley's claim that she has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"underwent a hundred medical ministrations," refused to allow.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Buckley says that

> What caused the political commotion was the sense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that we were presiding over an execution. Terri Schiavo remained\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"alive" until we stopped feeding her. Then she began a fall through\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a trapdoor descending toward death.

Is not the same true for every infant? Is it not true for most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Alzheimer's patients? For some mentally handicapped people?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Should we allow them to starve? Should we define away their pain,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even though we cannot enter into their thoughts to ensure our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#definition is accurate? Why are the courts not looking at the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cases of people who have been in "persistent vegetative states"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who have recovered? Why are people who ask these questions said\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be self-deluding themselves?
