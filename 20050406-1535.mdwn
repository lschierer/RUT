The Smithsonian's fairly recent exhibit on Ancient Rome\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#opened my mom's eyes to how much of current science and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#history is quite simply speculation. There is so much we do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not know, and yet they feel free to guess that this or that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ancient writer is biased in one way or another. They then\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#declare that reality must have been such and such, based on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#assumed biases of a given writer, and present that as fact! "[Flesh on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bones of 'first ape-man'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4416757.stm)" drips of the same sort of speculation,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though here at least we see *some* mention of other scientists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#criticizing such claims. Imagine basing your theories on a computer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reconstruction of what you *think* the skull looked like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before it was distorted by the forces of nature!
