"[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ten Commandments Reach the Supreme Court](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/politics/28commandments.html?position=&ei=5088&en=04622c8714f6c1b2&ex=1267333200&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=)" is yet another\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#update on the issue of the Ten Commandments in public displays,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#specifically publicly funded displays such as court rooms and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#grounds. President Bush is supporting it, and one law professor,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#surprisingly writing for a Baptist organization (just goes to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#show, you can't trust protestants ;-), is against it because it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"secularizes" a sacred symbol. How can a single Justice be said\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to have cast the deciding vote? Surely a reversal of *any*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of them would change it? Or is it simply that only Justice O'Connor\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#votes "inconsistently" on this issue?
