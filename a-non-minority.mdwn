New census results show that non-Hispanic whites are now a minority in one out of every ten counties in the United States.[\^200708081] Even if this continues to spread, I suspect it will not make one whit of difference in how we are perceived. We will never be granted minority status in this country.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200708081]: Mr. Sam Roberts.
