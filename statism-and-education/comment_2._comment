This collection is well named.  s/Lithuania was not under Communist occupation/Lithuania was not a state while under Communist occupation/.  technically my former phrasology was correct.  "as nation need not be a state, as, for example, Lithuania was not under Communist occupation" means that Lithuania was not a state then, not that they never were occupied.  unless that's what you were trying to debate.  As I understood and understand "state," lacking home rule, they were not one.
