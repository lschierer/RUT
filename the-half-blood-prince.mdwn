#+TITLE: The Half Blood Prince

I finished *Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince* tonight. It was a very good book. Much of it was happy and amusing, yet more-so than the previous books, it has ended on a sad note. Yet somehow that fits. I do hope that Ginny is smart and stubborn enough to stick with Harry. Once I rather wanted Harry and Hermione to end up together, yet this book managed to make me comfortable with her and Ron, and Harry and Ginny. I think the last book did its part in that as well.
