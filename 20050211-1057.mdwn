"[Test\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Set on Transmission That Could Save Fuel](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/10/business/10auto.html?ex=1265864400&en=31fc593620f00192&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt)" (NYTimes, registration\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nonsense) is an example of the kind of environmental action you like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to see. Coming up with solutions that are better for the environment\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#while still being economically sound. Why can't this sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thing happen more often? I think it relates to George Weigel's "[Creation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#groans](http://www.archden.org/dcr/news.php?e=116&s=3&a=2678)." Across the world, people are increasingly confused\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about Satan. Several news articles in the last 6 months have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#documented a rise in satanism, and it is common knowledge that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#increasing numbers of other people no longer believe in Satan as a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#real, discrete, intelligent, living being. Both are problematic in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their own way. This leads us to claim God responsible for things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that He did not will, but which are instead the results of rebellion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against Him. Along the same lines, from Romanticism on, and now\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#especially in environmentalism, there is this unsound notion that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#creation, minus man and his influence, is perfect. Utter rubbish,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but many people believe it. Thus much of environmentalism is far\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#too extreme to be really practicable, and some of it too extreme to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be even desirable. You can see this in Rachael Carson's *Silent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Spring*, where she mixes sound advice with utter rubbish, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has no problems advocating things that put people at greater risk.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For instance, she advocates allowing shrubbery to grow up along the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sides of roads when all the research done indicates that fatalities\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in accidents **drop** when the roadsides are clear of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ditches, trees, shrubs, so on, essentially the 2 or 3 car lengths\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of short cut grassy filed, possibly with near zero resistance wild\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#flower, that the Department of Transportation has advocated for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Highways for years.
