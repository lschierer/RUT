Another abortion case is going to be heard at the United States\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Supreme Court. This one is on the parental notification laws.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#New Hampshire "forgot" to make an exception for minor's health in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the event of a medical emergency. Perhaps because such clauses\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get abused by pro-death doctors. Anyway, with the current Supreme\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court mix, I do not expect anything good to come of this.
