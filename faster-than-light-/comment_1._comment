Essentially, what they are saying (I think) is that if you send a part of a signal of light over different channels and then use each fiber to record a different aspect of the original piece of data, and send them out simultaneously, then you will get data to appear to travel faster, when you will really be throwing out X times as much pieces of useless data.   Suppose a photon has 4 properties (up, down, left and right) which can be true or false.  if you have four fibres where you are sure that the photon in each represents the proper value of the data you want to send, they will show up four times as faster than if you'dve sent one light pulse.
