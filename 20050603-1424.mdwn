You have to read carefully, but there are some quite loaded\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#statements in the quotes the New York Times collected when\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#researching its article talking about how the change of one gene\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will determine whether fruit flies are "homosexual" or not.[1] From\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all behavioral appearances, a female fly with the male gene will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#still be female, but will attempt to seduce other female flies, will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#act more aggressive, and so on. The reverse is true of the males.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I wonder how long this gene is, I think I remember reading some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#place that a "gene" isn't necessarily just one molecule. I do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#know enough biology here.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But of even more interest was the statement expressing hope that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this will "take the discussion about sexual preferences out of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#realm of morality and put it in the realm of science."[2] There are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#several things wrong here. One, he clearly wanted this result.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am not saying that invalidates his research, any number of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people have come to research with ideas of what should be there,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and found something similar. But it is interesting. Secondly,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is interesting that he thinks, or wants it to be, possible to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#move something from "the realm of morality" to a *separate*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"realm of science." He obviously thinks that if his homosexuality\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is genetically determined, that his behavior must be unquestionable.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That is not the case. Lets pause here for a moment and consider\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a hypothetical case.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The basic unquestioned assumption here is that a genetic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#predisposition to homosexuality, even a genetic determinance of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexuality must lead to homosexual activity. The argument is that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these instincts and drives are so powerful that man by the exercise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of his will *cannot* prevent himself, or at least in many\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cases will not be able to prevent himself, from acting on them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is an unquestioned assumption, and I have seen it lead people\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to treat Dan Brown's heretical ideas with more consideration than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they deserve. For a moment here, let us take as a given that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#speculations that there may be a gene that "causes" some men to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rape women, just as it is claimed that this gene determines (if it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exists in more than fruit flies) determines homosexual activity, not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just homosexual inclination. This is not something that *I*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#am making up, though I have lost the reference. "Social Darwinists"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have come up with the idea that our genetic makeup may drive us to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many of our actions, and yes, rape is one of the ones they used\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as an example. The logic went that a serial rapist in a society\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that either cannot safely abort or has a strong taboo against\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#abortion will have an advantage over other men in passing on his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#genes, and thus there would be a drift over time towards rapists,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#somewhat counterbalanced by the sexual selection against them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#***If*** such a gene was found, if we found a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#gene common to all rapists, and lacking in those who do not rape.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Perhaps a recessive gene with carriers, but whatever: imagine such\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a gene exists. Would rape cease to be wrong? Would rape move\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"out of the realm of morality and put it in the realm of science"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in society and our societal perception of it?

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
I posit, more I assert, that it would not. We would still\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#consider rape wrong. We would consider such men diseased, and we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would seek their cure. Perhaps we would not lock them in jail,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but if not, we would likely lock them in a mental institution.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We would not leave our daughters, wives, and sisters at risk of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#assault by them simply because they "could not stop themselves."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The same holds true here. If a sexual preference determining gene\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is found, then we would and must still condemn homosexual behavior.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Such men are diseased, and a cure should be found. They are not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#normal, they should not be encouraged to flaunt their sickness.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Now, I am sure, any reader who does not know me is thinking\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that I am one seriously homophobic person. Such is our society.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#My actual position is beyond what is so far expressed though:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think that any such gene *need not be acted on*. Yes,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if it it exists, it DOES constitute a disease. But even if it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does exist, it does not excuse the behavior. Man's will can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and does determine his actions. Man can, by an act of will,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#restrain his instinct, yes, even his sexual instinct. Thus men\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and women have lived celibate lives. Thus while some have failed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in their vow of celibacy, some have *not* failed. And they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were not freaks to be able to, but rather the freak would be one\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who could not. Note, I say "could not," not "did not" and not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"will not." Many who *could* restrain their behavior to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#within moral bounds *choose* not to. Because it is easier.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Because they think they know better. For both reasons, for others,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it matters not. What maters is that it was a *choice*,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and one that could have been made the other way.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Remember then that the Church, and I, do not condemn, hate,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or fear homosexuals. We simply call them to a life of chastity,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the same life of chastity (celibacy) that we expect of unmarried\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#heterosexuals. *Perhaps* they did not choose their course,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*perhaps* biology forced it on the, but the calling remains,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the duty remains. And perhaps, some day, be it by genetic therapy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(if it is indeed genetic in humans as well as fruit flies), or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#perhaps by some other means, we will eventually find a reliable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cure for homosexuality. And then these men and women can go on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to live normal, healthy lives. And that would be best for them,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and for society at large.
