Just as [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/feature_earth.asp?p=1) talks about some environmental ideas, from an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#environmentalist's view point, albeit a non-fanatical one, [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/markalexander/ma20050422.shtml) talks about it from a skeptic's view. The juxtaposition\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is revealing. It is worth remembering that as few as 20 years\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ago, the big fear was global cooling, not global warming. It is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worth remembering that the science is not unanimously behind human\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#intervention being primarily responsible. And it is further worth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#remembering, that they do not say this is, with today's technology,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reversible. What is the point of cutting emissions if it cripples\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the economy (and thus slows down the development of technology)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without preventing the disaster? We need that rapid technological\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#growth if we are to ever be able to avert it. So yes, by all means,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#let us cut back where we can, as we can. Hybrid cars? Go for it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Better power plants? By all means. Nuclear power instead of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#burning coal? Sounds good â€” assuming we can settle the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#storage issues and such.

Another interesting point from the first article is that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when global cooling was the concern, socialism was the cure, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#capitalism the problem. Now that global warming is considered the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#problem, the solution and cure are the same. Excuse me, how can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#capitalism have caused both? In such a short time span?

From the first article, a good point about how environmentalists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*can* work with us instead of universally against us.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The development of hybrid cars is an inspiring example of such\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#co-operation. That cannot stop there though, it needs to continue.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We need human-friendly solutions to these problems. This earth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is *ours* after all, we are the reason for it, not some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accident.
