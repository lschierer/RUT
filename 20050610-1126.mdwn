The Attorney General of Nebraska is defending his state's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Constitutional amendment banning homosexual "marriages."[1] This\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was supported by seventy percent of the state's population, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was struck down by the courts. I am not really sure how a ban on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexual "marriages" or prohibiting such couples from enjoying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other legal protections denies them "participation in the political\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#process," which was the logic used by the federal judge who struck\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it down. It seems to me they have equal access to the ballot box\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#still, and equal access to run for office, how exactly are they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being denied participation?
