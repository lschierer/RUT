Today, as Mrs. Schiavo died, Boundless posted "[If\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I End Up Like Terri: An Open Letter to My Wife](http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0001064.cfm)." As Sister\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Chabel (spelling) at Gift of Peace house in D.C. said, She is in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#heaven now, we need to pray for her husband, her family, and all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#those involved in this mess. We also need to pray for each other,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that we will survive the turmoil to come, and that we will be taken\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#better care of if some tragedy reduces us to such a state.
