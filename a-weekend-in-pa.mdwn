#+TITLE: A weekend in PA

Lauren and I went up to Pennsylvania this weekend to visit my Dad's side of the family, most of whom Lauren has not met. Grandma hosted a shower for us, at which we also celebrated Aunt Marie & Uncle Joe's 40^th^ anniversary. We got to see all the aunts and uncles, and some of my cousins, and had a very good time. â˜º Chris took some pictures across the day, which he has posted [here](http://www.theschierers.net/gallery/v/Trips\_Travel/2007/July+in+McKean/).
