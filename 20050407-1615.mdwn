"[Hole\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Drilled to Bottom of Earth's Crust, Breakthrough to Mantle Looms](http://www.livescience.com/technology/050407_earth_drill.html)"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reports:

> Already the types of rocks recovered show that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conventional interpretation of Earth's evolution are "oversimplifying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many of the features of the ocean's crust," said expedition leader\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Jay Miller of Texas A&M University. "Each time we drill a hole, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learn that Earth's structure is more complex. Our understanding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of how the Earth evolved is changing accordingly."

> "We need to evaluate all the data we have from the cruise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and re-analyze the seismic data, to determine whether it's better to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#deepen the current hole or drill elsewhere, or maybe even collect\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#additional seismic data to better constrain where to drill," John\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#told LiveScience. "Our major result is that we've recovered the lower\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#crust for the first time and have confirmed that the Earth's crust\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at this locality is more complicated than we thought."
