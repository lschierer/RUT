#+TITLE: A failure of a people

Yesterday, Mr. Patrick Buchanan posted an editorial that I entirely agree with. [Go read it.^[1]^](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46315)

The magnitude of this failure shows itself as people go out not just to take food and water, but to steal televisions, designer clothing, jewelry, and other goods that have nothing to do with survival. It shows itself when they shoot at police charged with protecting them, and at rescue workers trying to bring them aid. It shows as they play the blame game after so many means of assistance were turned down by local authorities. It shows as the horror stories of the Superdome come out. It shows when some of them prove to be false as well, that people have no better motive than to malign their fellow man.
