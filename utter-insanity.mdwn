What sort of utterly depraved parent must you be to allow an 11 year old child to attend a "juvenile nudist camp?"[[1]](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/07-06-2005/de470006ef4bf3d1.html) I mean *at all* much less without a parent. Surely it does not take a rocket scientist to understand just how incredibly stupid that would be.
