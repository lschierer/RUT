There is so much going on in "[Appeals\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court Hears Chinese Custody Case](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-15-2005/20050215001504_17.html)" that I don't know what to make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of it. So many levels. There is no way to know what went on when\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"The Bakers took Anna Mae into their home as a favor to the Hes who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were out of work in a foreign country and facing large legal and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#medical bills." Did they think it was a sort of unofficial adoption?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Was it presented that way? Or was it known to be temporary, and they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were wrong to raise her as adopted? What about the child? Who does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#she consider "Mom" and "Dad?" That is, I think, unquestionably\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who she should stay with, regardless of the rights or wrongs of how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that came to be. And the immigration issues involved, what a mess.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Elian Gonzalez I think they were wrong to take him and send him\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#back to his father, but even that, it is so hard to be sure... The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only thing I know is that there is so much suffering when families\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get broken up. Such an incredible tragedy.
