The bias is subtle in a current New York Times article talking\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about the morality of treating children with severe birth defects.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It starts off okay, talking about how one doctor advocated treating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them and another did not, and society gradually took the choice out\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the doctors' hands in favor of treating everyone. But then it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#goes on to find two patients who "wish [they'd] never been born."[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And then it continues to correlate the meningomyelocele cases the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rest of the article had been talking about to infants with very low\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#birth rates. While admitting that we can now keep such children\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#alive, it highlights the problems some (many?) such children will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have later in life. And ends by asking if we should be treating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#such children at all.

The problem here is that this is consistently looking at the issue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from a quality of life perspective. That is fundamentally wrong.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Church teaches us that even the most handicapped life is worthy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of full respect as life, and is worth living. God has seen fit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to give life to these babies, it is not for us to decide that they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#should die, and to deny them basic treatment is to commit murder.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Perhaps they will never have a "normal" life, but perhaps the next\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Beethoven is among them. Or perhaps they will bring a smile to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one parents face with the love they can give. Either would be a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reason enough to have lived. And certainly their example will make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us all appreciate more the gifts we have.
