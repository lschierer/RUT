Since when do doctors get to decide what qualifies as a religion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#whose beliefs they must respectâ€½ That is at the heart of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a Texas case in which the state is attempting to take custody of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a 12 year old girl whose parents are opposed to the treatments\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being used for her Hodgkin's disease.[1][2] One of the articles\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#says they are utterly opposed, the other says they merely have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unanswered questions. Either way, it is unacceptable that the state\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is interfering in this way. I am always against state or federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interference with religious devotion because the same logic that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is used against members of any other faith could one day be used\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against Catholics.
