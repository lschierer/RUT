I read Oliver North's latest column, [Of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#faith and freedom](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ollienorth/on20050122.shtml), over at [TownHall](www.townhall.com). In it, I see that Michael\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Newdow, that nutty atheist who tried to get "under God" removed from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Pledge, and tried to ban mention of God in the inauguration, isn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the only atheist who feels threatened by a public display of faith on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the part of others. Now I've more or less known this for ages, but for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some reason, it still surprises me every time I see it that people can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#think this way. How insecure they must be in their lack of belief, how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#shallow they must be that they cannot stand upon their own atheism\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when confronted by the belief in God that Christians hold. While this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#might superficially seem to be a good thing, in that it should mean\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that it is easier to convert them, I don't take it that way. Rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than thinking it would be easier to convert such an atheist, I think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that he must rather be rabid, and will emotionally react against\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anything that hints of faith, without thought. And someone who refuses\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to think will not convert, their fear will hold them back. To really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#understand the scope of what they are doing, look at what the uproar\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would be if the situation was in reverse. They want to forbid us to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mention God in public, as public officials. Think if they were\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#forbidden to deny His existence in public, or as public officials.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Try to put such a restriction into practice, and you will quickly not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be able to tell the difference between the result and a theocracy.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Which is exactly what atheism would result in, since atheism is just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as much a religious/philosophical belief as monotheism. Shall we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#establish, in our zeal to "separate church and state" (a phrase that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is no where in the constitution, but, unfortunately, fairly heavily in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#US Supreme Court precedent, and thus in common law), establish a state\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#atheism? Enforce religion into a "God of the gaps" type practice, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ever narrowing bounds? I fear that we may yet see the full cost of our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"tolerance," beyond "Catholics" who do not believe what the Church\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#teaches, but to the point of suppression. Already in some places,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#special action is needed, and hopefully will be successful, to allow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Mass to be said^[1](#ref1)^. A mention of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#God in a speech is said to infringe, a prayer in a public event. Shall\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a Cross in a skyline be next? How about a rosary hanging from a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rear-view mirror in a public parking lot? Sound paranoid? Would you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ever have believed that there would be a challenge to the right of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#President to have a prayer said at his inauguration? I know I wouldn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
