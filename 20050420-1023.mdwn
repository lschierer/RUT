#+TITLE: A Second Strong Papacy

In "[From Wartime Germany to the Papacy](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/international/worldspecial2/20profile.html?ei=5088&en=781c1afbe24ac478&ex=1271649600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&position=)" mostly dislikes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the idea of a strong Pope, and the centralized authority he has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and represents. Ironically then, in its last couple sentences,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it underscores its importance. Many are in favor of the national\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bishop's conferences. They like the idea of religion being made\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to fit the region, instead of the region made to fit the religion.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#However, it is true to our own experience that this weakens the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expression of the faith. When is the last time the United States\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Conference of Catholic Bishops came out with a strong statement?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#All the strong statements, the ones that teach, the ones that let\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you know what Catholicism is and what it is not have come from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the individual Bishops and Cardinals acting on their own, while\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Conference has deliberated and disappointed again and again.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Nor is this unique, for this article, so critical of a strong Pontiff,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#itself remembers that the German Bishop's Conference was equally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#week and ineffective, equally disappointing.

Another of the NYTimes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#articles, "[An Evangelizer on the Right, With His Eye on the Future](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/international/worldspecial2/20assess.html?ei=5088&en=533d35e13d0597d2&ex=1271649600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&position=),"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#provides I think, the first and closest the media has come yet to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a good understanding. That he will combat the ideas that have made\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us sick, relativism, socialism, abortion. That he will help us to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#know what the Church teaches. That he has linked himself not only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to quiet popes, but to Saint Benedict, who helped shape Europe,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and infuse it with the monastic life.

"[Benedict XVI Sets Out Papal Goals in First Public Mass](http:www.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/international/worldspecial2/20cnd-mass.html?ei=5088&en=5ce20f89c2f6aca3&ex=1271649600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&position=),"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the other hand, fails to understand. Ecumenism is not at all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incompatible with the ideas of the preceding paragraph. Rather, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is necessary, we cannot afford the confusion of ideas, the confusion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of what is Christian. Indeed, Christian and Catholic are, and must\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be seen to be, synonymous. It is not a softer tone to insist that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he will continue the ecumenical efforts of Pope John Paul II, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather a firmness, a commitment to do all that is needed to teach\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#his global flock. Similarly, it is surprising that they are so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quick to forget the teachings of Pope John Paul II, who was said\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be attempting to "roll back Vatican II." Continuity with his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#predecessor will not give us with a "transient" pope in Benedict XVI,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but with another strong pope, one I hope God will grant many years\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of service to us all, that we may be left in a stronger, clearer,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more unified position, unswayed by priests and bishops who teach\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us falsehoods.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Meanwhile, some in the United States are wary, "[Bush welcomes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pope Benedict XVI](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4463403.stm)" was quick to point out openly what is implied\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#throughout the NYTimes.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> A few in the progressive wing of America's Catholic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#population of 67 million have expressed surprise or concern at the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#choice of the Cardinals, with critics suggesting the new Pope's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conservative views may polarize opinion.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Naturally, here, where so many routinely ignore the teachings\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on abortion (I myself have heard Catholics say "I do not like it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but it is their choice"), on birth control, divorce, and other\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#issues, it really isn't surprising that some are less than pleased.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Why would they be? They now have a second pope who they will be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ignoring. Those that hope to change the Church are in for a second\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#frustrating pontificate. â˜º According\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to [this BBC\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4463503.stm), the Philippines is on the same page that Father Buckner\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was on in his homily last night. Ecstatic to have another strong\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pope who will help us grow, as Saint Francis de Sales would have said\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(my PVI upbringing showing through), "in faith and wisdom."

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The excerpts of his homily, [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4464363.stm),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seem to me to confirm what I have said. Ecumenism is needed on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#path to "reconstitute the full and visible unity of all Christ's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#followers." And he intends to be "to be a rock on which everybody\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can stand with confidence."

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Interestingly,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4463519.stm) continues the pattern of thinking his homily before\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the conclave would have **encouraged** his election.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Father Buckner had literally the opposite take. He said that we can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#clearly see the hand of God here, because if anything ensured that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pope Benedict XVI would not have been elected, it was that homily,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in which he chastised his fellow Cardinals for their failings\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and weaknesses. This take strikes me as more true to reality.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#While this is *precisely* the tone we need, we need to have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our course corrected, it is not a homily calculated to gain friends\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or supporters. Humanly speaking, our new Pope spent his time as head\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faithful making enemies,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#telling people with influence in the Church that they were wrong,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and to shape up.
