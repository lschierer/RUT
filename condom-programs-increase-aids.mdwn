#+TITLE: Condom programs increase AIDS

The [National Catholic Register](NCR) provides the scientific facts behind the Pope's recent statement that there is a risk of increasing the problem of AIDS in Africa by distributing condoms.[\^20090416-1] This article provides documentation to some of the things I had considered myself when I have found myself defending the Church's position, as well as bringing up a few things I had not thought of. The long and short of it is, unsurprisingly, that the available empirical research demonstrates that, for one reason or another, you simply cannot remove the risk from "casual sex." Only "partner reduction" or better yet "abstinence or being mutually faithful with an uninfected partner are the most effective ways of avoiding infection.”[\^20090416-2]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[NRC]: http://www.ncregister.com "National Catholic Register"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^20090416-1]: Ms. Susan E.
