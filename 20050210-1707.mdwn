Walter Williams, insightful as always, writes in "[Not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yours to give](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20050209.shtml)" about using public funds for charitable causes.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#No matter how laudable, it is not the role of the government to give\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this money, nor is it efficient. Rather than spending this money\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in this way, return it to us, and we, who are consistently proven\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some of the most generous people on earth, can then give more of our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time and money directly, without the overhead of IRS, the rest of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Treasury (is that a second DOT, or is it the Treasury Department, or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is it part of some other Department?), Congress, or any other civil\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#servant to drain some percentage out. Interestingly, he quotes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a number of public officials from our history who have agreed:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Tennessee Rep. Col. Davy Crockett, President Grover Cleveland,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#President Franklin Pierce, Virginia Rep. William Giles, and President\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#James Madison all come down against public charity.
