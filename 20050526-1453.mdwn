This week I have been trying to get GNOME to sit up and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#realize that changing from focus theft to pop-under is less than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ideal.[2][3][4][5] After a somewhat rocky start,[1] I finally seem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be making progress. This pleases me not only for the narcissistic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reasons, but because it really will make a difference to our users.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For all I am more than willing to utterly disregard the opinions\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and reports of demanding and/or annoying users, I *do* care\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about the success of Gaim, and *do* want the Linux users'\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#experiences with it to be as pleasant as possible. That is why I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have gone along with things like slashing preferences even though\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is not always defaulting in ways I like. Still, it is very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#frustrating to deal with these GNOME guys. They are so convinced\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that it is absolutely essential to usability that the focused window\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not be obscuredâ€¦
