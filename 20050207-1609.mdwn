The [ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/index.ars) writer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thinks that this may aid in protecting citizens from police abuse as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#well as monitoring them as potential criminals, but I have my doubts.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Tapes in the control of police are going to be used against them?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I don't think so.
