#+TITLE: Inadequate explanations

> Simply comparing the structures of various organisms of differing sophistication without explaining where the more primitive ones came from in the first place, what genetic mutations could practically have resulted in the existence of these more advanced ones, and how each successive organism's neuro-muscular system knew what to do with this new information to allow for functional survival, would, for most inquiring minds, seem to be inadequate.[[1]](http://www.arn.org/docs/glicksman/eyw_050201.htm)

In just a few lines of text, Dr. Glicksman neatly sums up what would constitute a rebuttal of Dr. Behe's *Darwin's Black Box* or Mr. Glicksman's own columns. The sort of rebuttal that has not been forthcoming. The kind of explanation described as inadequate here is the type of explanation I tend to call a "just so story," a phrase that dates to Mr. Kipling's work, and which I picked up from this use from one of the other ARN authors.
