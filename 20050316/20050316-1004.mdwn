<p> <a href="./view.php?date=20050315-1403">Yesterday</a>
I referenced a pair of articles on Terri Schiavo,
the Florida woman whose husband wants to let her
die so that he can marry another woman and keep her
money.  Today, I am reminded of this by Chuck Colson's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/chuckcolson/cc20050311.shtml">Life
or death in Florida</a>."  I often disagree with Mr. Colson, he can
get Protestant-preachy, but this article nicely sums up the fact that
people we think are unaware sometimes are aware, the sketchiness of
Mr. Schiavo's own position, and the lamentable, deplorably lack of
protection that Terri Schiavo is receiving, protection that one would
have thought would be built into our system.  As Mr. Colson says,
"As things stand, any convicted felon on death row would now be
granted more rights than Terri. At least the felon would be allowed
legal representation."</p>
