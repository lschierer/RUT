Rounding out the news I read this morning, Mr. Pat Buchanan wrote\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an article on the debt forgiveness proposal that bears commenting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on.[1] In a couple respects he is correct. He is correct that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#clause talking about the need to take anti-corruption measures is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a joke. It means that either no debt relief will occur, or that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no reforms will. He is also right when he says that we the tax\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#payer will ultimately bear the burden for this.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But he utterly ignores the fact that we would be doing so anyway.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#These debts are beyond the resources of the current, admittedly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#corrupt, governments to pay. With the current financial structure,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the presence of these bad loans would have served as reason to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#further prop up these governments, lest they get overthrown and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the new government not agree to honor the debts. Further, for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the most part, only interest was being paid anyway, the debt was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not decreasing.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
While it would be nice to see the IMF and the World Bank held\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accountable for these loans, it is useless to say that it should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#happen just as it would to "any U.S. government bank" for two\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reasons. One, there ARE no "U.S. government banks. The Federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Reserve bank has a U.S. mandated monopoly on the production of money,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and uses government resources to do so, but it is a private bank.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#As are all the other banks. Secondly, only small banks are allowed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to fail anyway. Bigger banks get rescued by the Federal Reserve\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or by Congress directly just as big corporations such as Lockheed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or United Air have been. This is exactly the same thing.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
It is also the right thing to do. Yes, these loans should never\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have existed. And yes, the governments are corrupt. But that does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not excuse us crippling any chance these countries have for even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#minuscule advancement under the heavy debt burden that currently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exists. If we do not accept what are ultimately our own mistakes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(through our elected and appointed officials), these countries will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#never have a chance to give their people a decent life. And that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#alone tells you what the right course of action is. It is our fault\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they have these loans, our fault that the interest cripples them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is thus ours to bear the default on them.
