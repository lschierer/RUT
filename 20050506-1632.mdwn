Protecting athletes from being held back, suspended, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expelled for lack of academic performance is plaguing even some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of our Catholic schools. This really serves no one any good, as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they will not (likely) be in sports for the rest of their lives.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The number of people getting passed along in grade school and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#high school is significantly higher than the number of people\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in professional sports after all, and even the professional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sports athletes typically retire young. Which brings me to [the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#story of a teacher being fired for refusing to change a grade](http://www.accessnorthga.com/news/ap_newfullstory.asp?ID=60362).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#One of his students appeared to be asleep in class. The teacher,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no doubt frustrated by the lack of effort that the student was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#putting into the class, lowered his grade, and was fired (after\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#refusing to restore it). Tell me, what has this student learned?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That he can do whatever in class and it will not matter. How does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this prepare him for the real world out there, beyond the school\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#doors, where he will have to make a living, and support himself\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and perhaps a family? It does not prepare him; it prepares him\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only for a life on welfare.
