"[Appeals\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court Rules Against Wiccan in Va.](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-15-2005/8d5c000a2296a4d8.html)" shows an appellate court\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#getting things right for a change! A Virginia county barred\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a Wiccan priestess from giving the opening invocation because\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Wiccans are not consistent with the Judeo-Christian understanding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of God. The Appeals court upheld this, saying that as the county\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has a wide range of faiths represented, they are meeting the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Constitutional requirement. If this reaches the Supreme Court,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it will, no doubt, be overturned, as their decisions tend to go\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#towards an anti-Christian understanding of that Amendment. Still,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is nice to see that one court, at least, understands things.
