I see that Rigoberta Menchu is [in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the news again](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4332925.stm). I wonder if her allegations of racism\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are more truthful than her autobiography is. It was an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#assigned reading for one of my college courses, and shortly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#afterwords (unfortunately just as the semester ended), I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#found a [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article and a [Boundless](http://www.boundless.org)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article that references it. You can find the Boundless article [here](http://www.boundless.org/1999/departments/isms/a0000074.html),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but the New York Times one is older than its archives system\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#allows you to get at for free. Basically, the Times exposes her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#autobiography as being almost entirely fraudulent. She did have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a good education, her brothers were not killed by either poverty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or government troops (she states that one died of malnutrition and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one was buried alive), her family was not intimidated and oppressed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by wealthy land owners. She made it all up, and got a Nobel Peace\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Prize for it. If I were the judge or on the jury in her current\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#case, I would have significant concerns about her credibility.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Would you?
