I have learned that the 11th Circuit Court has refused to order\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the reinsertion of Mrs. Schiavo's feeding tube. One of the three\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#judges dissented. The AP leans fairly heavily towards death in "[Schiavo\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Appeal to Reconnected Tube Denied](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050323/D890I7N00.html)," but perhaps I am giving\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them less credit than I should; they do mention\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> In court documents, the couple said their daughter began\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"a significant decline" late Monday. Her eyes were sunken and dark,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and her lips and face were dry.  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"While she still made eye contact with me when I spoke to her,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#she was becoming increasingly lethargic," Bob Schindler said in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#papers. "Terri no longer attempted to verbalize back to me when I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#spoke to her."  
> \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Louise Cleary, a spokeswoman at Woodside Hospice, said she\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#could not discuss Terri Schiavo's condition for reasons of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#privacy.

Michelle Malkin [has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a better write-up](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001831.htm). She also points out the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#irony that someone who doesn't have a right to life\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#still has a right to privacy. There is something\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#***SERIOUSLY*** wrong with that picture.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#David Limbaugh also added to his archive last night, posting [an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#email he was sent](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/i_love_this_ema.html) which asks a question my mom asked me\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yesterday. It is one thing for the court to have ordered and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#enforced the feeding tube removal, a horrid decision, but perhaps our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#deplorable legal system necessitates it. (I do not think it does,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but perhaps.) It is beyond that for them to order and enforce no\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ice chips or such. If she truly cannot swallow, truly cannot take\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anything orally, there is no need for this order: such attempts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would fail to keep her hydrated, her own family would prevent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them to give her a few last hours while they fight for her life.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It thus follows that what we have here is not just an attempt to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"let nature take its course" without the feeding tube, but to ensure\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#she dies. That is a depressing thought.
