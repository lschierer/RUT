We are taking things way too far in "[Eating bananas is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#racist? How stupid can you get?](http://mhking.mu.nu/archives/067455.php)." I'm linking to this rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than to the google archive because this is likely to be up longer,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and having read the google archive of the story, I can say it reports\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accurately, though I would not have given the mayor *quite*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as hard a rap as this author does. What does it say about us when\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simply eating a banana is to make a racist statement, one that a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mayor would apologize for?
