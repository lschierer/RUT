#+TITLE: The Earth's core spins independently

I need to read *Deep Hot Biosphere*[[1]](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387985468/103-6989850-1954223?v=glance) again. I no longer remember his ideas well enough to know how they would mesh with seismic evidence that the Earth's core is rotating faster than the surface is.[[2]](http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050825_earthcore.html) This, and related research that shows that the mantle is also spinning faster, provides at least some proof for the plate tectonics theory that I dislike. It at very least demonstrates that there *are* three layers to the Earth's structure, which is a prerequisite of plate tectonics. It does *not*, however, demonstrate that the crust is split into segments that move independently or semi-independently. It would, in fact, seem rather hard to make a categorical statement that the crust is rotating at *any* single speed, if different segments of it are in fact moving in different directions. This would, however, be dismissed as simply an average speed that averages out, necessarily, to a speed in the same direction the Earth rotates. Earthquakes and mid-plate faults remain the strongest flaw in plate tectonics.
