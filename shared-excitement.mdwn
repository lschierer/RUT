Fr. Frank Pavone, M.E.V. shares my excitement and reasoning.^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^ He goes on at much greater length, emphasizing the importance of electing pro-life officials, and looking ahead at some of the hints on future progress the decision gives. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Wesley J. Smith is cautiously pleased.^[\\[2\\]][ref2]^ He is concerned that this ruling can be seen as a affirmation of *Roe* and *Casey*. His legal analysis is not entirely gloomy though; he sees this as a step up, despite the affirmation. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
