<p>I did not say to reform the Church <em>by</em> reforming society.  I said that attempting to reform the Church and meanwhile ignoring society would, and is, proving to be an impossible task.</p>

<p>You cannot ignore the larger society that we are embedded in if you want to achieve true reform of Christian lives.  This does not mean that Christians are justified in doing whatever simply because it is acceptable to the larger society.  We are called to a higher standard.  But it does mean that we must work to bring the standards of society to be more nearly in line with our own standards.</p>
