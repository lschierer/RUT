While the New York Times claims that this is an "implicit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rejection of the administration's policy," I call it local\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#governments taking charge of their own affairs in a laudable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#manner.[1] The left argues that this is good for us, then responds\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that it is so good for us that we cannot be trusted to implement it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ourselves, it must be mandated from on high. And yet, why not let\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people decide for themselves if they want to live, or work, in a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"green" county or city? Why not let them decide for themselves\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what measures are reasonable or cost effective? Is that not what\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#democracy is supposed to be all about: ceding governance to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the populace? Naturally, you could question how effective the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Kyoto Protocol will be if only some places implement it, but I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ask how effective it would be if *everyone* implemented it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#From what I gather, this cannot halt global warming, cannot reverse\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it. The changes we have seen, if changes they are, are here to stay\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(or change further). Why then, if global warming cannot be halted,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do we not expend our energy attempting to learn how to live with it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather than fighting fruitlessly against the inexorable?
