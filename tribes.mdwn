Via Mrs. Michelle Malkin,[[1]](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/003470.htm) my attention was directed at an essay by Mr. Bill Whittle.[[2]](http://www.ejectejecteject.com/archives/000129.html) This essay, though laced with some objectionable language, does a very good job at going beyond race, beyond political parties, to look at (a simplified version of) the realities of people. In doing so, he looks at why some people make good leaders in times of trouble and others poor ones. And in doing so, he explains some of how the disaster that is New Orleans came to be. It is well worth reading.
