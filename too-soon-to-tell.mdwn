In the news today is a ruling on a death penalty case in which Justice Alito voted to stay an execution pending more arguments before the appeals court.^[{1]](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1138874710211&rss=newswire\ "Alito\ Splits\ Ranks\ With\ Conservatives\ in\ Missouri\ Death\ Penalty\ Case")^ This is news because Justice Alito did not vote with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas. The death penalty certainly *can* be just and right. It *is* within the powers of the State, if exercised appropriately. The key though is "exercised appropriately," which translates to "only when we cannot otherwise protect society." I doubt we are in such straights anywhere near as often as we sentence to death. And so I can understand Alito's vote. Let us pray that he votes pro-life not only on this issue but on all.
