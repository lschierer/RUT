#+TITLE: A Design Inference

The spread of nuclear weapons, which can never justifiably be used in war, is certainly depressing news. There is, unexpectedly, a lighter side to the news though, however slight. Even the most ardent proponents of materialism are forced to admit that here it is only common sense to look for the difference between design and chance. Can we detect the difference between a nuclear test and an earthquake? Seismologists, both those open to intelligent design and those against it, are confronted with this question.^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
