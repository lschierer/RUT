"[Marriage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in Maryland of Cousins Draws Fire](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-05-2005/92c60014335f4d0d.html)" amuses me as I once got\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#marked down on an paper in 8Th grade because, having read the book,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I realized that the two children in *The Secret Garden*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were cousins. My teacher marked me down because I "must" be wrong\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as first cousins marrying is illegal. This article points how how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#regional that thought process was.
