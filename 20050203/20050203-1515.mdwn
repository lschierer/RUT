The [New York Times][nyt1] has a story on a new (very
expensive) gadget that creates a 3D video display.  Entitled 
"[Virtual Home Theater Promises Immersion and Fits on Your Head][nyt2],"
the article talks about its use for people who want to watch a
presentation or movie, but this isn't so much what strikes me
about it.  Gnome has and is working on what they call "spacial"
metaphors for file management, and there is lots of talk about 3D
interfaces, especially in science fiction.  Short of a true Star
Trek&#xae; style hologram, this offers really what seems to me to
be the first viable way to really go 3D; imagine what that could
mean for computer desktops, organizing your work flow.  We'd need
some other pointer type device naturally, a mouse wouldn't make
much sense in 3D, perhaps a way to tell what a person is focusing
on, or something similar.  It would probably confuse many users at
first, but for those of us who are used to multiple monitors and/or
multiple work spaces, this would be an interesting advancement.
