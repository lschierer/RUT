Michelle Malkin has a good run down of the No Child Left Behind Act\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Revolt Against No Child Left Behind](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001585.htm)." This bill is being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#challenged in all sorts of ways, which I think is good, as I do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like the idea of the Federal Government meddling with our schools\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and our children's education. Local control is far better, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#local control you can occasionally get good things going, as for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#instance somewhere in southern Virginia the kids are being bussed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the local churches for religion classes during the school day.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Can you imagine a federal program doing that? In this era of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"separation of Church and State"?
