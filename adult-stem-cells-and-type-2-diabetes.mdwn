#+TITLE: Adult Stem Cells and Type 2 Diabetes

There is or is going to be an article in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science talking about a study in which adult stem cells, which pose no ethical problems, were used to cure type 2 diabetes in mice.^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^ This is the sort of thing that \*ought\* to be incredibly news worthy. It will be under-reported, however, because of the focus on embryonic stem cells.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
