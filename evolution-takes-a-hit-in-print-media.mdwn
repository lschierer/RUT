#+TITLE: Evolution takes a hit in print media

It is nice to see a lucid and well written article supporting "intelligent design" in the media.[[1]](http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=8543) I do not know much of anything about the American Spectator, so I cannot evaluate how typical or atypical the decision to include this article is for that publication. Regardless, it is a well written summery of the movement, and where things stand, and well worth reading.
