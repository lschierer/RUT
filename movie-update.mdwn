This seems to be the summer of Luke movies.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We watched the new Indiana Jones movie tonight. I very much enjoyed it. We also need to see the new Incredible Hulk movie and the new Batman movie. I'm also told that the Iron Man movie is worth watching, and I expect that the new Hellboy movie might also be worth watching. A super-hero summer indeed. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#â˜º
