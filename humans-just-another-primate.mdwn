#+TITLE: Humans, just another primate?

I read about the London Zoo exhibit featuring humans sometime a week or two ago. I intended to write about it, but never did. Someone else has done the job, and done so well. Thus, I highly suggest that you read [this](http://www.catholicherald.com/bonacci/05mb/mb050908.htm) [Arlington Catholic Herald](http://www.catholicherald.com/) article.^[1]^ Ms. Bonacci is correct, it is ironic that in many ways this exhibit actually serves to contrast humanity from the animals that we normally populate our zoos with. For, truly, what other species would we have to concern ourselves with the modesty of, or provide mental stimulation for?
