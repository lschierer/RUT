Lest you think otherwise, the ACLU is not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the only anti-religious organization out there. "[Court\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#OKs AmeriCorps, Catholic School Link](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/03-08-2005/b753001814e05ffc.html)" reports that of all groups,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the American Jewish Congress is trying to prevent Americorps from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#placing teachers in religious schools, and from partially reimbursing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#religious colleges that aid in preparing the teachers. Not at all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what I would expect to see a religious organization doing. Anyway, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#am always somewhat suspicious of seeing federal funding used towards\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#religious education, I am constantly fearful that it will be used\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as an opening to try to legislate what can go on in these schools.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We have seen that fear mirrored in some colleges that will not accept\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#federal student aid money for the same reason, at least I think we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have, I would need to look it up and verify that fact again.
