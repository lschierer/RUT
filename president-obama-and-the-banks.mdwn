#+TITLE: President Obama and the banks

The [Wall Street Journal][WSJ]'s Mr. Stuart Varney presents a chilling thought in an alleging that the current administration is refusing to allow an unnamed bank to return funds loaned to it.[\^20090404-1] The creditability of the article is reduced by the failure to name the bank or the source. Still, his logic is hard to deny; President Obama is certainly a socialist. It is a very scary thought, and I can but pray that it is not true.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[WSJ]: http://online.wsj.com "The Wall Street Journal Online"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^20090404-1]: Mr. Stuart Varney.
