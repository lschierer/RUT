From the sound of "[US backing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#down in abortion row](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4314181.stm)," it seems that the US is backing down\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on this pro-life issue. That is unfortunate, I can only hope that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#either the article is wrong, or the analysis that the amendment is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not needed is correct. However, I find the odds of the latter to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be low, as it would require the previous reports of NGO pressure\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be inaccurate, which would defy common sense.
