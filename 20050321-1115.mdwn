I was reading [Planet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#debian](http://planet.debian.org/) today, and noticed [this](http://www.red-bean.com/~decklin/blog/tech/atmos).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Someone built a clock that uses a variety of energy sources to wind\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#itself mechanically, with no user input beyond the initial push to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get it started after leveling it. Ederlyn would probably find this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cool, and would most likely have a far better understanding of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#physics than the poster does.
