Mrs. Michelle Malkin has posted[1] a remarkable example of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the harm that political correctness can do to society. Political\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#correctness is an interesting way to silence dissent and mandate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#censorship, as no one likes to be called racist, sexist, so on.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#People will flee these emotionally charged labels so fast that they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will often give in rather than attempt to debate the accuracy of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the label. Indeed, in today's atmosphere, an attempt to debate it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather than fleeing tends to exacerbate the harm done in the minds of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the listeners, who are unlikely to engage the issue rationally.
