Legal news run down.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Iris Scanning\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#To Begin At Orlando International Airport](http://www.local6.com/news/4479554/detail.html)" not quite legal news,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but not quite not legal news either. This is not a development I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#particularly like to see.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Senators\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#debate merits of Patriot Act while agreeing no abuses have been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#documented](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/p/56/05-11-2005/2e12000da28a8a8a.html)" Quite a few of these clauses *need* to go.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The [EFF](http://www.eff.org) has details on this bill.

"[Judge\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Rejects DMV Practice on Licenses](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/c530000adf2147d6.html)" This comes right as the REAL\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ID Act passes in Congress and awaits the President's signature.

"[Judge\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#OKs Day Care Center for Blind Couple](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/c78700127ab801dc.html)" Sad to see the government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bullying people like this. I would tend to think that parents can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decide this one, and beyond that, this couple has apparently been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#doing daycare, as employees of someone else, for some time now.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Surely they would be aware of their ability, or lack there of, to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#take on the whole job. Also, how would their blindness "adversely\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#affect" children? I could see the agency saying that they would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not be able to do the work, I could see them saying the children\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would suffer neglect, but if that is what they meant, why not just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#say so?

"[Calif.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Panels Reject Gay Marriage Ban](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/e4fd001a4d27fd5c.html)" I am not giving this one a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#post of its own since homosexual "marriages" are still banned in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#California. But it is sad to see one more protection for marriage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the family denied.

"[Marijuana,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ten Commandments and Retirement Questions Await Supreme Court](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115802310733)"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#offers a brief look at some of the cases that will be heard in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#United States Supreme Court this year.
