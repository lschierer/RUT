Quite a bit of activity surrounding Terri Schiavo (I have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been misspelling her name apparently). Congress still has not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#managed to pass the right to life bill, apparently still haggling\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#over the narrow one specific to this case that the Senate passed.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They are looking to exercise eminent domain or some such to move\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the case to federal court, that apparently requires justification.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In a rather neat twist, the House as subpoenaed her! This action,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it seems, forbids her doctors and such from acting in a way that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would cause her death. They've also ordered as much, it seems,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though that might just be confusion, but its unclear they have the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#power to do so. Still, I read that the Florida judge ordered the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tube removal stayed at least until the House subpoena is cleared\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up,if it is â˜º. This is all over the New York Times,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the BBC, some in FindLaw, some on Drudge, David Limbaugh and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Michelle Malkin are also writing about it. I am not going to try\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to provide links to all these stories here, you can find them at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#http://www.prolifeblogs.com/articles/aggregator.php?schiavo=1 .
