Today being Ash Wednesday means today is a day of fasting and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#abstinence, and I am certainly feeling it. I went to the communion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#service at St. Veronica's at lunch today (it was scheduled in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bulletin as a Mass, but that was apparently an error) and received\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#my ashes. A good thing, since its hard to make it to a Mass after\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#work much of the time, but it means I didn't have time for lunch.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So "One normal meal (except no meat) and 2 small meals that together\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do not equal a full meal" has quickly turned into "one normal meal"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for me today. Ah-well, such is life.
