<p>Alex,
I understand your concerns.  Still, I think reversing this decision would be a poor way to address them.  Deryni addressed a very similar concern in <a href="" rel="nofollow">http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/414#comment:60</a>.  Essentially, what you need is not the protocol of the top buddy, but the protocol of the <em>current conversation</em>.  A plugin could add a protocol icon to the conversation without too much trouble.  There is a notification area in the top of the conversation window.  While Pidgin itself uses this only for the typing notification, it is accessible to plugins to add icons of their own there.</p>

<p>I suspect if you were to write such a plugin, we would accept &amp; maintain it.  This is not our usual course when dealing with plugins, but I think it would help people to accept the new way of looking at IM, and deryni has expressed that he would be willing to accept it as well.</p>
