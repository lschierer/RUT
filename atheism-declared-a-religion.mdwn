#+TITLE: Atheism declared a religion

While some are apparently upset with a recent decision that declares atheism to be a religion,[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4697) I am pleased. Where atheism firmly established as a philosophical basis legally no different from theism, then the court-enforced secularism, which amounts to court-enforced atheism, would fall apart. You clearly cannot bar God from the public sphere if doing so amounts to an establishment (traditionally defined OR popularly defined) of atheism as a state religion.
