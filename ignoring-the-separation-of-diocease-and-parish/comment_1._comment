I agree with you.  However, if the churches are primarily funded by the diocese and the diocese is liable, that means the diocesan monies get diverted to the liability, and away from parishes that need help (or in some cases, like in Northeast PA, dead churches that nobody wants to fund, but nobody wants to let fade away).
