I have not, however, been producing valid xhtml. To do so,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I need to remember to url encode my links, and also, apparently, a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"blockquote" cannot appear inside a paragraph. I have to end the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#paragraph, start the blockquote, and then start a paragraph after\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ending the blockquote. The logic appears to be that the blockquote\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can contain paragraphs, so a paragraph cannot contain a blockquote.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That sort of makes sense, I guess, but it is logically inconsistent,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as, when writing, I generally continue the previous paragraph\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#after the blockquote. This follows from years of highschool and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#college writing. Still, since in web pages I use a block format,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not indenting my paragraphs, it visually produces the correct output\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this way, so it matters little.
