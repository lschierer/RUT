\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Last week I wrote about how it is a mistake to add fuel to the fire over the badly thought out reaction to cartoons mocking Muhammad and Islam.^[[1]](https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20060210-1102/on-offensive-cartoons-protests-and-counter-protests\ "On\ Offensive\ Cartoons,\ Protests,\ and\ Counter-protests")^ This week, I read Mr. Pat Buchanan doing much the same, using other, but equally cogent, reasons.^[[2]](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48786\ "The\ cartoon\ wars")^ Actually, some of his logic is rather similar to mine, he just goes on at greater length and has as his starting point security here at home rather than concerns over freedom *of* rather than freedom *from* religion. His article is well worth reading if (as is likely) my commentary was incoherent and/or unconvincing
