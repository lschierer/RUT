Did you know that we are spending $10,000 *per student* at the Federal level *alone*?^[[1]](http://www.townhall.com/blogs/c-log/Dan%20Mitchell/story/2006/01/18/182943.html\ "America\ spends\ too\ much\ on\ education,\ not\ too\ little")^ I certainly did not. What is the Constitutional justification for all this spending? Where does all that money go? If the states and the teacher's union are to be believed, it is *not* reaching the classroom. Granted that, why should we be spending it?
