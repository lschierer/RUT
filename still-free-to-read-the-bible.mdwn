#+TITLE: Still free to read the Bible

There exists an elementary school that has a "reading time" for its third-grade students, in which they may read a book of their choosing. One child chose to read the Bible, and was told by the school that he may not.[\^bible724] Unfortunately, I cannot honestly express surprise that this series of events happened in the United States. Fortunately, the school in question backed down after receiving a letter from the Thomas More Law Center reminding them that such activity has been repeatedly protected by the United States Supreme Court. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^bible724]: Catholic News Agency.
