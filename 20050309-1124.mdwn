Pat Buchanan is off his rocker again. In "[Unpardonable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sin of Larry Summers](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43203)," he's confusing different aptitudes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for different levels of intelligence. Apparently someone who is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#good at math and science but not so good at English or history,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or perhaps your stereotypical geek/nerd who cannot handle social\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#situations is more intelligent than those less skilled at math\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and science but more skilled in other areas. So apparently your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#autistic savant is among the most intelligent people out there.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He also opens the door to the very thing that the movie "Gatica"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#depicts, he writes "Can it be that biology is destiny?" While I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do not think that he would go so far as "Gatica" does, I think it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is incredibly dangerous to be opening the door to allowing society\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to expect differing levels of ability and achievement for different\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#segments of the population. Rather, I still believe that equality\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will only ever come when the differences cease to be noticed.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I believe that you will not achieve racial harmony while having\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#different races, that it can only come in a color-blind society.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Again, I am speaking of ideals, but this time perhaps an obtainable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one, for already we see any number of interracial marriages blurring\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the lines between the races, if we were to require racial blindness\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in our colleges and applications process, i.e. refuse to allow it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be on the forms, get rid of the quotas and instead simply insist\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the most qualified being accepted, I think you'd go farther\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#over time. You might see some stratification, perhaps in part\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because of the sort of aptitude that Mr. Buchanan refers to, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#also because some groups self-discriminate against achieving in a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#meritocracy. [Boundless](http://www.boundless.org)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had an article on this a few years back, "[Defending\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Race](http://www.boundless.org/2000/departments/pages/a0000385.html)," which has some interesting numbers. For example,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"the children of black parents who earn $50,000 a year on average\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#post lower SAT scores than white students whose parents earn just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#$10,000." This, and other numbers in this article, largely come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from *Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by John McWhorter, a Professor of Linguistics at UC, Berkeley.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I would suggest you look at the Boundless article at very least\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before getting on my case too much on this topic.

Returning to my original thrust, while you might see some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#stratification, the demonstrable existence of a meritocracy would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have its own effects, it would tend to undermine the types of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#self-discrimination that lead to my tangent above. It would tend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to allow the exceptional individuals that through hard work or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#genetic "luck," go beyond the "tendencies" of their race or sex\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to in fact do so. It would not, of course, be easy to monitor\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or ensure in practice. Unlike a quota system, which nice easy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#statistical results that lend themselves to government oversight,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a meritocracy is much harder to evaluate and regulate. After all,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at times you have equally qualified candidates but can only hire one.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#At other times the ability to define on paper what constitutes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the most qualified candidate can be difficult. Take for example\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the true story that the movie "The Sixth Happiness" tells, of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a lower class English woman determined to be a missionary, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who was in fact a successful one by any meaningful definition.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Yet she was unqualified for the position according to the China\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#missionary society. Their rules were too strict to allow for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exceptional people, obviously an undesirable situation as well.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Where does the balance lay? I am unsure, I just know that quotas\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the unreasoning drive for "diversity" is not it.
