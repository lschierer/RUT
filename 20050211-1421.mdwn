"[Octopus\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Arms May Point Way to New Robot Designs](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0209_050209_octopus.html)" talks about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#using octopus arms as a model for robot arms. It also has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some peripherally related tidbits of interesting information.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Of particular note, I noted an indication of the design in life on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learning that octopi use their arms almost as if they had bones\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#after they have caught their prey. This isn't proof of design,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is not meant to be, after all, it might turn out that is the ideal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#way to handle the situation, scientists looking at it as a model\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#appear to be betting on that. If on the other hand there are two\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or more roughly equivalent ways to handle boneless arms, what makes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this one the one of choice? Evolution would certainly not cause a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#critter to \*loose\* its bones, and so I assume that scientists would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#put octopi rather earlier on the branching than the development\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of bones. Thus this would have to be an example of "convergent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#evolution," a case in which design makes a far better explanation:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the designer favored certain patterns.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If that isn't speculative enough for you, I'd like to consider\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#something else. We have computer-organic hybrids (mentioned\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[here](./view.php?date=20050207-1623)), and we have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#robots potentially mimicking emotions and reproducing (mentioned\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[here](./view.php?date=20050204-1128)). Combine the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#two, and how do you tell the difference between the artificial and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the real? In a rather humorous twist, I can only imagine creating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#something, loosing a few of it in the ocean, and then some scientist\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a hundred years from now "discovering" it and speculating about how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it evolved. Of course it will be utterly ridiculous to say that this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"new species" was created. ;-)
