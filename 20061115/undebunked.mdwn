Mr. George Monbiot publishes an article<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup> in rival paper "The Guardian," addressing some of Mr. Christopher Monckton's claims.<sup>[\[2\]][ref3]</sup>  His refutation is much less referenced.  He also falls into the fallacy of assuming that anything that comes from a peer reviewed journal is necessarily more authoritative than anything that does not.  Considering some of the utter garbage claiming to refute Intelligent Design that I have seen coming from peer reviewed journals, my own perspective is to take both the news paper article and the journal article at face value, and give neither greater credence.

Still, it may be that Mr. Monckton has overstated his claims and/or been misleading himself.  I think the refutation insufficient, but then I am hardly objective.
