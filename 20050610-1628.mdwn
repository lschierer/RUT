In the news today is something that really ought not to surprise,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but yet qualifies as "news." Apparently scientists, human as we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all are, have been fudging their results.[1] Sometimes to fit their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#instincts, sometimes to match past work, sometimes to please those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who provide the funding. Yahoo News, apparently quoting a Washington\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Post article, is careful to call these falsifications "minor,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and to say that they do not qualify as "outright misconduct." I,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#however, ask the question: how often did the modifications of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#experiment design or results cause the overall result to change?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#How often was global warming predicted because contradictory data\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was thrown out? How often was it predicted by an experiment that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"they knew would not give accurate results?" How often do we see\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#10 studies "proving" something because the authors published the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#same data twice? These lapses are admitted to by four to fifteen\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#percent of scientists (depending on which exact offense you are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#looking at), which to me makes the problem seem fairly widespread\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for a process that we are supposed to trust implicitly.
