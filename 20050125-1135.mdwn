According to [this story](http://www.wral.com/news/4126577/detail.html),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Weyco Inc. has a policy that prohibits its employees from smoking,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not only on company time, but at all. Basically treating it like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an illegal drug. To me this seems like the right approach for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*State* and *Local* governments to be taking; why in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#world are we trying to end smoking by making it prohibitively\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expensive and difficult (restricting where you can smoke)?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This seems really misguided. On the other hand though, banning\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#drugs hasn't exactly worked now has it? Much like the prohibition\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#didn't work. I don't know what the right approach is.
