Michelle Malkin reports on the conviction of some democrats in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what sounds like a very sizable corruption case.[1] I would tend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to bet that this sort of thing is far more common than is good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for us. I am also positive that it *was* a politically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#motivated investigation. Republicans only investigate democrats,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and democrats only investigate republicans. Both go more or less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#party lines (as is amply demonstrated as the democrats forced\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an investigation of Tom DeLay, which he widened into a general\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#investigation, which, surprise surprise, turned up democrats doing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the same thing (as well as other republicans)). Along the same\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lines, I have seen a friend of my father's imprisoned for much\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less, for evidence my father maintained all along was fabricated.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If someone wants to find something, the higher up in government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you go, its either there to be found, or they will make it found.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Either you are dirty, or they are, such is politics.
