In a world with Dan Rather, and as Wired Magazine pulls numerous\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#articles for fake quotes[1], as conservatives are rocked by the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#scandal of conflicting interests (being paid to write, or being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#paid for similar things), and numerous similar things, I wonder\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how John Leo can, with a straight face, tell us that we will lack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accountability and verification in the absence of traditional news\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sources.[2] I am not one to discount the service they provide,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though I often do disparage them. After all, how many of my posts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would exist without the major news source to back it up? And I am\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not so foolish as to think Townhall.com could pay all that many\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the journalists whose columns make up most of the rest of my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#posts. Still, time and time again, we have seen a *lack*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of verification happening in the traditional news media, which,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to me, says that things could not be *worse* if we had\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to categorize our news by how much we trust the source instead\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of being told we can blindly trust the media. Which reminds me,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he seems to share this idea with much of the media "elite" that in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the absence of media to tell us what is important, what is true, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would not question it for ourselves. He worries that there would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be a higher percentage of gossip and rumor accepted as fact, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we have endured months of speculation over what President Bush's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Social Security plan would be, when he had released no details.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Who double checks the media? It was hugely noteworthy when ABC\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decided to investigate "American Idol," hugely noteworthy because it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so rarely happens that anyone seriously questions the credibility\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of a major network. Or at least, no one except the populace who,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#apparently, are choosing to find their news elsewhere.

On a side note, is this barrage of national and international news\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even good for us? We all know about the international problems, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hear nightly about the latest horrors, but who knows what happened\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in their own town? Could you tell me who was married in your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#parish this weekend? I could not, could you tell me who moved\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#out in your neighborhood this week? Who moved in? The barrage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of national and international news, the barrage of sensationalism,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is depressing, I cannot stand to watch it on the television, and I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#read it online only out of boredom, I am aware it really is not all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that good for me (except to the extent that I do find motivation to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#write about it and thus exercise my intellect in some minimal way).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Perhaps in the absence of the major news sources there would be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fewer investigations of Global Warming, perhaps we would be less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#likely to know of the problems in the Congo. But then too, perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we would be less interested in solving everything at a Federal level\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and more interested in the decisions our Board of Supervisors make.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We would be more interested in the programs going on in our parishes.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We would be more interested in these things because they *are*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accessible to the unfunded individual, they *are* immediate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to our lives, and so would continue to make its way to our daily\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#intake of news. When the overall volume decreases, the noise to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#signal ratio simply cannot stay constant, people, with less to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wade through, will more quickly learn what to pay attention to.
