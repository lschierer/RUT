Apparently I have almost never written here about the Second Amendment. That somewhat surprises me. I was looking at TownHall's "C-log" today, and found [this gem.^[1]^](http://www.townhall.com/blogs/c-log/DanMitchell/story/2005/10/20/172128.html "Good news for 2nd Amendment supporters") Like the one post that a simple search here finds on the topic,^[[2]](https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050406-1141/20050406-1141\ "20050406-1141")^ it provides facts and figures on the reality of gun control and concealed carry permits. Worth taking note of.
