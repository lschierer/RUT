#+TITLE: Mosquitoes!

Air Pollution in Athens Greece has been blamed for a noteworthy development in mosquitoes.^[[1]](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060704/hl_afp/greecehealthdisease\ "Air\ pollution,\ cramped\ living\ in\ Athens\ breeding\ 'super\ mosquitoes'")^ Apparently, the mosquitoes there are growing larger, with better vision and better smell. They are also growing faster. The end result is that they can detect you at 25-30 meters instead of only 15-20. And the faster speed makes it more likely they will reach you. This makes me want to go to Athens oh so much, how about you?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
