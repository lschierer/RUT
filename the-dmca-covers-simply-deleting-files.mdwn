#+TITLE: The DMCA covers simply deleting files‽

According to [coupons.com](http://coupons.com) it does.[\^200708211] Mr. John Stottlemire figured out that deleting some files and registry keys off of his computer would allow him to print unlimited coupons from [coupons.com](http://coupons.com), and posted instructions on how to duplicate the effect, and a program to do so automatically for those unable to follow the instructions. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He had to expect that he would be sued, the idea that they would see this as a reason to give him a job is ludicrous. That being said, I agree with Mr. Kravets that the idea that the DMCA considers this hacking a program to circumvent copy protection is worrisome. I should have the right to delete anything on my computer without fear of suit. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200708211]: Mr. David Kravets.
