Pidgin developers seem extra-picked-on, and I'm not sure why that is.  Perhaps it is that people who use IM frequently are also more likely to get on IRC and complain (as opposed to someone like me, where I'd have to start by downloading an IRC client and figuring out how to use it).

I like Pidgin.  I liked Gaim.  I liked the old icons.  I like the new icons.  I'm easy to please.  I used Gaim and continue to use Pidgin because I support free software, and because I don't want all the adware and other encumbrances of commercial IM clients.  I appreciate all the time (and, it would seem now, real money) that you and the rest of the Pidgin developers are spending on a client that I can use freely (both libre and gratis).

I think there is a strong chance that the Pidgin developers suffer the wrath of a vocal minority.  I suspect that there are a number of people who are silently cheering you on, and an even larger number who simply don't care either way and will use whatever you deem best.  (Some of us have more important things to evaluate than whether the icons you chose are the best possible choice.)

So thanks.  A true, heart-felt "thank you" to you and to the other Pidgin developers.  And chin up -- I suspect a lot of us are on your side. :-)
