I just installed 2.2.0 today, and I looked at the protocol icons... nice, but now I'm used to them not there.  Maybe I'll use them eventually.  At any rate, each release of gaim/Pidgin has been an improvement in my opinion.  Sucks that the developers get so much flak because it's just getting that much more indespensible to me with each release!  Don't let the vocal minority fluster you, you're doing great work.
