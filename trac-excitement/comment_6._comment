Luke,

The Pidgin developers do a great and often under-appreciated job.  That's one of the problems with Open-Source.  People get conditioned to the stream of freely collaborated software and take it and the process for granted.  This will only get worse in the future.

I rarely weight in on such matters, this is the first time I have ever commented on Pidgin even though I have used it for years.  However, like Joe V said "I like Pidgin. I liked Gaim. I liked the old icons. I like the new icons. Iâ€™m easy to please..."

I have been aware of the whole menu and protocol icons for some time and was simply glad to go along with whatever got rolled out but I must confess that I like the protocol icons in Pidgin 2.2.0.  For someone like me who has accounts on almost every IM and who has friends with multiple accounts themselves it is a nice feature to have a visual cue, for example, to see which account I am referring to at a glance so that I can access the correct logs to copy and paste info.

The Gaim/Pidgin 2.0.x beta process was one of the longest betas I have seen for an Open Source utility.  And since betas imply that things are in flux and may not work properly or even work differently after the final release it is silly (for users) not to expect that the process is anything but "one step backward and two steps forward".
