Some time ago, I first noticed a case in which a New\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mexico church is being baned from using a hallucinogenic tea\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"sacramentally." It is in the news again, with articles in [the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4458873.stm), and in [the CS\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0419/p03s02-usju.html) (and others, but these are the two best articles I see).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I find that it is being looked at now because of the Religious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 which ordered the courts to look\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#harder at religious exemptions to laws that are otherwise general\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in application, something that the Supreme Court restricted rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#significantly in a 1990 decision. When last I noted this, I wrote\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the following:

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> Also in today's news, religious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#freedom is under attack, though subtly. [FindLaw](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1154/12-1-2004/20041201153017_41.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#documents the story, in which a New Mexico church is being blocked\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by the Feds from using some weird hallucinogenic tea. What is the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#big deal you ask? Surely we do not want people using hallucinogens\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#right? Well, yes, but at what cost are we stopping them? In a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather unlikely scenario, say prohibition comes back and we sub out\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hallucinogenic tea with wine. Now back in the days of prohibition,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we had a stronger sense of religious freedom, so churches everywhere\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had a dispensation, and were allowed to purchase and distribute wine\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for use in Mass. But under this sort of precedent, it would be all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#too easy to say "alcohol is dangerous" and prevent, or at least make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#illegal, the Mass. Precedent is always dangerous to create you see.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#You never know how it will be used.
