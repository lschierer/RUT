Okay, so I've now imported all the old log entries into Word Press. It is FAR from pretty, and all the links across posts are broken, but the content is there and I still have the original files if I ever want them. Many thanks to Vincas for the import script. Oh, and the limitations of the import are my fault, not his, because he did exactly the part I asked him to do. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I'll be working on getting this log to \*look\* right later. For now it is bed time.
