Lately I have taken to glancing at the articles on Focus On The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Family's Boundless website.[1] Even though aimed at college kids,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and protestant in tone, some of its articles remain thought provoking\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and pertinent. This week they have posted an article talking about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the "two income trap." More and more, you see both parents working.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This has been noticeable in a variety of ways, for example, schools\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are now more likely to close than to risk needing to close early.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For some reason an employer is more willing to accept that you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot come in at all than that you must leave unexpectedly early.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Similarly, the number of two hour delays have gone down. This last\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#winter highlighted the ridiculousness of this when schools were\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#closed several days that they need not have been.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Returning to topic, another way in which the two income trap\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#shows up is that couples often find that they "cannot" do without\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#both incomes. Far from one of them being "extra," they come to find\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that loosing either would constitute an emergency. This article[2]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#talks about that. It sketches, in reference to a full book on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#topic, how couples come to depend on that second income. They buy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a more expensive house, in a school district that everyone wants\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be in (more competition means higher prices). They buy more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#expensive cars (cars with televisions in themâ€½). They pay\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for day care, they eat out more. Perhaps, like my aunt and uncle,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#neither knows how to cook much or well. They thus introduce expenses\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they would not have with a single income, and then cannot afford\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to loose either.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
My parents avoided this differently. By refusing to take a job\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#outside the home, working only with day care, my parents choose\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less costly vacations, less fashionable clothes (not that we kids\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#particularly noticed or cared). We still go out less than many\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(most?) people I know, and go out more simply, so that I know\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather less about the area restaurants than many of my friends.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We had a garden, and my dad worked other jobs. We got by, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholic schooling, even in this super-expensive area. So I tend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to look questioningly at people who think they need two incomes,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the boundless article comes to a similar conclusion.
