Spent a long time out at the datacenter yesterday with Vincas. We managed to get rex up with a grsec non-modular kernel, but we were less successful with gabriel et al. After some failed attempts, we did get it up with a 2.6.19.2 kernel though. Hopefully this will be the last long downtime for a long while, though we do need to migrate /home to the coraid at some point.
