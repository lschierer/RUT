Of course a constitutional ban on "gay marriage" must\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be overturned. No way it can be valid. That appears to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be the mindset of a gay rights group in Oregon, as documented [here](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-1-2005/20050201033008_02.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#One can only hope that the Defense of Marriage Coalition is correct,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that the challenge will not succeed.   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#There is quite a bit that is objectionable in [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0201/p01s01-ussc.html) from the [Christian\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/). I'm not exactly sure where to start. How is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an understanding of marriage as binding "more restrictive"? I would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#say it is "more accurate." On the plus side, it appears that some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#places are looking at the same sort of marriage preparation classes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the Church requires. Once again, it raises the specter of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#statistics suggesting that making divorce less accessible would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#somehow increase domestic violence. In general, I am leery of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#statistics, but it would be nice to have a set of my own to wave\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#back and say "no it doesn't." A governor in Michigan seems to have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the right idea: get the state out of the lives of the citizens,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"But the decisions men and women make about marriage are private\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decisions. State government should not expand its role into such\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#private matters." Also raised in this article is a less obvious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but really much bigger issue. We have fallen incredibly far if a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#law that says the state shall presume "that a husband is the father\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of any child born to his former wife within 300 days of a divorce"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot even be taken for granted! Heaven help us.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#***What in the world is Cardinal Cottier\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thinkingâ€½*** This crazy cardinal over at the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Vatican has managed to err in three ways at once! First and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#foremost, how is it that a cardinal does not know that you do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#choose "the lesser of two evils," but rather that you choose the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one guaranteed way to end evil: abstain from it. He's advocating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#condom use because it might help slow the spread of AIDS. Never mind\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that simply not having sex when infected, and not having sex with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#multiple people would go far, far further to halt the spread of AIDS\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without choosing an evil at all! Next he thinks that condom use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would slow the spread of AIDS. Given the failure rate on condoms,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#such that they will not even effectively stop sperm, how in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#world does he think they will slow the spread of AIDS? And the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#failure rate is generally computed when they are "used correctly,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which means there must be a way to use them "incorrectly" presumably\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with a higher failure rate. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he said all this where it could be quoted, and make it to the press.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So now the press gets to cheer and spread the word about "the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#growing number of influential Catholic Church figures questioning\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the official Vatican ban on condom use." And they get to go on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to say "The point is that the Vatican is slowly being forced to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#admit by some of its most authoritative churchmen that this is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#complex moral argument which does not allow for a simple overall\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ban on the use of condoms." By the way, both of these quotes are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4226489.stm). *This* is why there is such a thing as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"scandal" and why it is considered as serious as it is.
