#+TITLE: Mormons and polygamy

I am told that the law(s) against polygamy are not particularly enforced in Mormon dominated Utah.^[[1]](http://www.townhall.com/blogs/c-log/EmilyYee/story/2005/11/03/174091.html\ "So\ judges\ interpret\ the\ law...\ but\ don't\ have\ to\ live\ by\ it?")^ But I am also told that Mormon's no longer believe in polygamy. Something does not seem to add up here.
