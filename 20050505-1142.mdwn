Ederlyn [waxes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lyrical](http://www.livejournal.com/users/baranoouji/206573.html) and says more and better than I ever could on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hypocrisy of complaining about immigrants not knowing English.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I did not leave a note there, my thoughts are only tangential\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to hers. She is certainly right, many are just as she describes.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#On top of that, many come here so that their children will have a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#better chance, and then the school system lets them down so badly.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It has no expectations, and is more concerned with their "emotional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#health" and "racial identity" than their education, and ability to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#succeed later in life. The children, left in a vacuum as their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#parents struggle to support the family, or sink into despair in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the face of our dehumanizing welfare system, join gangs, create\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#violence and problems that then backlash against their communities.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The immigrants take jobs that by and large we would not, President\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Bush is right on that one, and get treated like dirt for it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I thrill to see in the comments of one of her posts that Ederlyn\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is teaching them about minimum wage and job interviews. And yet,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I do not think that authorizing illegal immigration is right either.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We are not overrun by immigrants, given time, given effort on their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#part (doubtlessly present in many if not most cases) and effort on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our part (mostly lacking), we could assimilate these immigrants just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as the European immigrants went from ethnic enclaves in the cities to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being so assimilated that we have, as a culture, forgotten the racial\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#problems we once had. This will happen over time effort or not.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And we, the native born, *will* be changed in the process.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Do you think it will be the first time? Read history again.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Irish *certainly* changed us. The influx of eastern\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Europeans did as well, look at the prevalence of beer and the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#relative drop in hard ciders. The Italians? What area is without\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it its Italian restaurants? What *is* "American" food?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It seems a mish-mash of every other culture, and so we, as a people,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are in many respects. But the melting pot takes time, it has never\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been boiling hot, and is certainly rather tepid now.

On the other hand, it certainly is not all that pleasant when\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you are working second shift, and the cleaning people come in, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you do not know Spanish worth a darn, certainly not at the speed and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#complexity they speak it, but you are not blind either, and you can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tell by the body language that some of that conversation is making\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fun of you and your co-workers, making use of the fact that they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*know* we do not know Spanish. And it does not help matters\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when I, as a white male, am *presumed* to be oppressive,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ignorant, and bigoted. The racism and stereotypes go both ways.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And it ***certainly*** does not help that my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#entire post will be utterly dismissed now that I have written this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(relatively) short paragraph.
