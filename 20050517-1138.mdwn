The Washington Times is characterizing Pat Buchanan somewhat\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#differently than I have read him recently. One of us (the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Washington Times or I) is, must be, wrong.[1] Neither of us is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#necessarily correct, however. In this case, I think this last\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is true. Perhaps this is hubris on my part, if so, so be it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I have asserted that Mr. Buchanan is proposing and endorsing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#run-away isolationism. Considering political realities, which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think Mr. Buchanan must be doing, I think I may have taken his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#argument to an extreme that he might not object to, but would not,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in point of fact, attempt to implement. He is quoted here saying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that he would allow in immigrants who are here to work, *and*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here to live. It is the flood of migrant workers, migrant in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sense that they are here to work, but intend to leave to live their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lives in their native country, that he would stop. He thinks this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is necessary to preserve our cohesion as a country.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
He is absolutely correct. It *is* necessary that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people feel at home in the United States, that they feel that it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is *their* home, that they join our culture, reshape it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#certainly, but learn from it also, if we are to remain one country.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is necessary that the melting of separate cultures continue if we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are to end the problems of racism. It is the black communities'\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#insistence on holding on to a *separate* identity that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proves the theory of the civil rights era: you cannot have "separate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but equal."

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Further, he is absolutely correct when he says that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conservative movement has fragmented. It has fragmented worse\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than his examples show. You have people who call themselves\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conservatives who favor government intervention if it means more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#security. You have people who call themselves conservatives who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would reduce the right to bear arms if it means less chance of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#terrorism. You have people who advocate federal intervention to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#end computer viruses and spam, yet call themselves conservatives.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#You have people who want economic reform without social reform,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yet they too are calling themselves conservatives. You have deficit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#spenders, who are conservative because they are for a strong defense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#department, and "moral conservatives" who once alone would have been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#called "conservative." All these groups, all called "conservative,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all under the republican umbrella, demonstrate why the Republicans\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fragment under pressure, even pressure from a minority democratic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#party. Because each has a different agenda, and so each is willing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to jettison a different piece of the puzzle to further their special\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cause. Contrast this to the Democrats who are just as fragmented at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#primary time, but yet know that the solution they all want is a more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#powerful government and more powerful democratic party, and so they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unify again as each election ends. Thus you see feminists advancing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexual causes, thus you see both helping the green activists.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This also holds true when you look at those who do not re-unify,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you see them not in the democratic party, but in the green party,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the other third parties.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But he is wrong in thinking that this union is worth saving,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or can be saved. We can, and should try, to save it for a time.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We can perhaps preserve it for generations to come, but if we are to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#survive for long without being Balkanized to meaninglessness, the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#union that will exist will be a union that we will not recognize,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though it may be one that our founding fathers would. What will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#survive will be the government that a moral people need to curb those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who transgress the common morality, one aimed at curbing exceptions,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not at suspecting all. It will be a self-policed state, just as we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#once where, where the pressure of society holds you in check far more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than the fear of the law. One where certain acts are unthinkable,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and so, when they happen, the justice is swift and sure. It may\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be a less gentle society, but it will be *more* civilized\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for that. Perhaps it will be a republic, perhaps a representative\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#democracy such as we have now. Perhaps it will be a more centralized\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#government, a monarchy or oligarchy. Perhaps it will cover the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#same territory, or perhaps we will have fragmented beyond repair.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Time will tell. Perhaps it will come soon, perhaps there is yet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#another two or three hundred years before it comes. Perhaps we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have reached the lowest depths of depravity, but I think not.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The reaction will not come until we do, the reaction will not come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#until good people are forced to admit they must act to preserve\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#themselves and their children in a world gone mad around them.
