William brought [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/080bysuf.asp?pg=1) to my attention. I'd heard about this guy's research\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from other places, and it really doesn't surprise me. Like most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(good) work from an economist, this conforms to the "it makes sense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#once you say it" rule. This article has more detail than the one I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had seen, and I find the fact that it was sent to me significant,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the research in question is more noteworthy than I had originally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thought. It appears there is a *chance* that this will not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be ignored.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[Michelle Malkin](http://michellemalkin.com) [writes](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001374.htm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about some of the effects of Europe's burgeoning Muslim population.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mostly consisting of quotes from other works, this is a good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#introduction for those who think that Muslims will assimilate into\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their host cultures.
