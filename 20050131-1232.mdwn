\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Any number of places are reporting that SBC is planning on buying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#AT&T. Makes me feel rather sad. AT&T has done good things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and bad things like any other corporation, but it really is, as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the NYTimes states, an icon that is now disappearing.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Why in the world do non-citizens have the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#full range of constitutional rights? See [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#BBC report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4223561.stm), [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#AP News report](http://reuters.myway.com/article/20050131/2005-01-31T170559Z_01_N31419718_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-SECURITY-GUANTANAMO-DC.html), or others.
