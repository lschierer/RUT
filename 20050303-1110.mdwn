I note that the ACLU apparently does not have a problem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with the display of American Indian religion in public, funded\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with public money. Terence Jeffrey talks about this in "[Is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Smithsonian promoting religion?](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/terencejeffrey/tj20050302.shtml)." This just goes to show\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you, it is a battle against Christianity in the public life that we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are engaged in. The talk of a separation between church and state is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quite simply rhetoric, and it is amazing that religious people have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been accepting this unquestionably for so long. I find myself once\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#again tempted to get David Limbaugh's book, *Persecution*,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I know it would simply enrage and depress me even further.
