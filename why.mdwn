oh why is there no support for the Areca raid controllers in the stock linux kernel yet? They provide source code, they have packages for a number of different distributions (and often several versions of those distributions). Support for it was in the -ac kernel back when there was a -ac kernel. Why has it not been accepted? It would make my life \*so\* much easier.
