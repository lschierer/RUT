Pat Buchanan has come out with something rather … odd. In "[Democracies\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#& double standards](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42987)" he argues that President Lincoln's behavior\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#during the American Civil War justifies Putin's behavior in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Russia now. What right did Lincoln have to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> suspended habeas corpus, sent troops to prevent a free\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#election in Maryland, sought to arrest Chief Justice Roger B. Taney,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#shut down newspapers, shot down rioters on the streets of New York\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and made himself dictator of the Union

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or any of the other egregious actions he took during the Civil War?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#How does having a failure in our own history excuse the failure\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of others? If the south had managed to find allies, how would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that have been different from France aiding us in our revolt from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#England? (On a side note, this is exactly what the Emancipation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Proclamation was about: keeping England out of the war.) How can we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#NOT call Putin on his retreat towards totalitarianism? What sort\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of credibility would we have if we failed to? Basically, what in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the world is going on in this article‽
