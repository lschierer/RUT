#+TITLE: Sonar Generated Piano

I am not quite sure how exactly generating piano music from sonar advances volcano erruption prediction, but it does generate some interesting audio files.^[[1]](http://www.geant2.net/server/show/conWebDoc.2153\ "Research\ Makes\ Mount\ Etna\ Sing!")^ Perhaps the lack of clarity is intentional in the press release, or perhaps its because I did not devote the time to reading it that I should have. Either way, the audio alone makes the site worth checking out.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
