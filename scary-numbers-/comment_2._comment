<p>I assume from your reference that you are referring to verses 11-16 of the first chapter, where Paul condemns the devisions among the Corinthians.</p>

<p>From this, we can certainly see that Paul must abhor our modern state, with thousands of Protestant denominations.  But we cannot arrive from his statements to any condemnation of the one, holy, apostolic and universal Church.  For Paul rightly calls all Christians to be one, as Christ is one.</p>

<p>But how can we be one without some authority to tell us what is, and what is not, part of the teaching of the apostles?  They are not here to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Nor is the Bible self-sufficient.  There are thousands of Bible believing congregations out there, each teaching slightly (and sometimes significantly) different things, each claiming to be following the clear words of the Bible.</p>

<p>No, if there is to be unity, there must also be those to whom God has entrusted stewardship of His Church.</p>

<p>I follow the faith as passed down by those stewards, the successors of the apostles.  For that reason, I am part of the Church, which is sometimes called Catholic, or "Universal."  Those who attempt to be Christian but refrain from full communion with Christ's Church are the ones who fall foul of the verses you cite.</p>
