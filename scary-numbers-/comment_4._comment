<p>Tewha,</p>

<p>I think this calls for a short study of the etymology of those two words, catholic and protestant.  The word 'catholic' comes from the greek kaqolikos, which means, quite literally, 'universal'.  Many protestants, knowing the origin of the word, would claim to be a part of the catholic, universal, christian church.  As for the word 'protestant,' one may argue that the word just means "one who is a witness before."  This, however, is not the historical origin of the word.  During the early years of the reformation period the term protestant was used to describe a collection of princes and imperial cities who had protested against the decision of the 1529 Diet of Speyer and enforced the 1521 Diet of Worms.  The Diet was the parliament of princes of the Holy Roman Empire.  That said, using the very old, original meaning of the word 'protest', I would not be against someday all christians being catholic, protestant, orthodox (the third being another former word of contention).  I like to think that these rifts, as divisive as they are, eventually allow us to find further words to describe and explain what it means to be "Christian".  I hope that the words stop dividing soon, but unifying.  But this will all indeed take time; God's time, not our own. :)</p>
