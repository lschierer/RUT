I read today an article talking about the New Madrid fault.[[1]](http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050622_new_madrid.html) Apparently they now think that there will almost certainly (seventy percent chance) be a significant earthquake there in the next fifty years or so. The interesting thing here is that while they insist that plate tectonics is behind it, *there is only one plate on both sides of that fault*. What other plate is the rubbing, sliding, snagging, whatever going on against? How does plate tectonics explain a *mid plate* fault line?
