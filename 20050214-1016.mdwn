A dose of hypocrisy for you: "[Bloomberg\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Criticized on Gay Marriage Laws](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211101505_05.html)" has someone being criticized\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for *failing* to act on his beliefs, but instead choosing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to uphold and defend the rule of law. If this were reversed, do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you think there would be calls for him to oppose gay "marriage?"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Do we see people in Massachusetts who oppose gay "marriage" being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#praised for refusing to follow the supreme court decision?
