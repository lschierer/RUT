There was nothing really note worthy in the news today. Well,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Apple is going to Intel chips from PPC ones, which I think is an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incredibly stupid move, but I did not and do not really feel like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#writing much on that. And Debian finally got sarge out the door,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I have known about that coming 2 weeks now or so. So I really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#did not have anything to write about today.

This weekend was incredibly busy. Nicholas graduated from PVI\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Sunday, and so we had lots (for us, though not as a percentage of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the possible family) of family and friends around us all weekend.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We had lots of fun, or at least I did.

Friday morning I woke up to the realization that after the last\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#update Thursday, I was not just unable to start stuff in X in that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#X session, but at all. This was incredibly unacceptable. I toyed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with trying to downgrade enough to get it to work, spending more time\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than I should have on it, but gave up, realizing it was beyond me.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So I started a re-install back from Ubuntu, and then upgrading it to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Debian again, except using the non-gcc4 amd64 repository. Gcc4 being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the start of the troubles on my previous install. This is the second\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time I have used debian's, dpkg --get-selections and --set-selections\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to preserve the information on what packages are installed across\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an install. I am *very* pleased. By Saturday evening, yes,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with the help of my dsl connection, but with very little interaction\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on my part, I am back up and running.
