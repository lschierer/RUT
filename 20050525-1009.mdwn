Last week Chris sent me an article talking about the use of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#encryption in the Revolutionary War and colonial periods.[1] Turns\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#out that various encryption methods were very well known and quite\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#widespread for government, business *and interpersonal*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#correspondence. So wide spread was the use of encryption, that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#courts "have not treated those persons who have used encryption,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ciphers, and codes with any presumption of illegality."[2]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In criminal cases, "evidence that a defendant used a cipher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or encryption has been allowed (as in United States v. Burr) as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proof of the means used to commit an illegal act, but as proof of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an illegal act by itself."[3] This is significant to remember in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#light of a Minnesota case where the existence of a PGP encryption\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#program on the defendant's computer was deemed evidence, by both\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the trial court and the appellate court, of criminal intent.[4]

A caveat here: The crime the defendant is accused of is horrific,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and if guilty, he should be locked up for life with no chance\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of parole.

Still, it is disturbing to see that an encryption program, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no evidence of encrypted files, or its use in any way related to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#crime, is evidence that you intend to break the law. There are any\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#number of good reasons to use PGP, or its free clone, GPG, beyond\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#illegal activities. For instance, many open source packages come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with GPG signatures to help prevent a man in the middle attack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from substituting a modified version of the package either in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the mirror you are downloading from, or via a transparent proxy.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Similarly, PGP/GPG signatures are used to verify identity in email\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#correspondence, and, just as it was in the colonial period and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the early days of the country, used to encipher perfectly legal,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but personally sensitive information to protect it from friends,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#family, neighbors, and random people out on the Internet who should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not be reading it. It is disturbing to see how quickly after finding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#such research, I see confirmation that it is indeed necessary to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have it.
