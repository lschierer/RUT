* We have had no warming over the last 16 years.[^20121115-2]
* Previous statements to the effect that a 15 year pause might mean that the climate models are wrong has now been extended out to 20 years.[^20121115-3]
* The World Bank and the US Research Council released reports that talk about the gloom and doom of the world being four degrees warmer, but not one word of how probable such a scenario is.[^20121125-1]  The report is further troubled, in my mind, by some questionable assumptions:
  * If Greenland once again becomes green, that would be a net plus for livable land, not necessarily a bad thing.
  * While sea levels rising might be troublesome, efforts to predict the sea level is even more questionable than global warming is.
  * While drought is unquestionably bad, how can we be sure that the record breaking droughts we just experienced are related to global warming?  Even if they are, can we be sure that an additional 4 degrees would not cross some tipping point and increase humidity - and rain fall?  A more humid, and a wetter, earth is speculated for the eons when dinosaurs lived after all.
  * Any link between war and weather is unquestionably highly speculative.  Correlation *can* mean causation, but people are in general far too quick to assume causation. 
  * Coral reefs are something I personally treasure.  They are most threatened by tourism though.  Even with no change to the CO level in the water, they are on the road to extinction - because people will not control themselves.  A "save the reefs" movement predicated on global warming initiatives will be far from sufficient to save our reefs, nor is their (significant) benefits sufficient to out weight the reduction in livelihood for the many that environmentalists would impose.
