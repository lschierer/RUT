Ms. Barbara Perry thinks that if Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court is confirmed, that it will signal/mean that there is no more anti-Catholicism with respect to the Supreme Court at least.^[[1]](http://news.webindia123.com/news/showdetails.asp?id=151671&cat=World\ "Catholic\ majority\ seen\ for\ Supreme\ Court")^ I disagree. I think that the very fact that his faith has been raised and noted means that it is and continues to be an issue even if his nomination does get through.
