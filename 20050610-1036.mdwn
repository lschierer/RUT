I am pleased to see that some 18 countries are possibly going to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be forgiven their debt.[1] I worry some that we (the US taxpayer)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will have to pay it off for them, but we would eventually end\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up doing so anyway. I also wonder under what terms this will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#happen, and what all it will entail. I see from the article that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the countries will have to prove a reduction in corruption and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"improve governing," a phrase that seems awfully ambiguous to me.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Also somewhat disturbing is the blatant expectation that this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simply means these countries will borrow more. That, I think,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is the last thing they need to be doing.
