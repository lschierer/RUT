So I moved Mom over to the new post page I wrote yesterday.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Seems to work well. Turning off fancy quotes was fairly trivial,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only took me about 5 minutes to find it. I think the complaints\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about it I saw online (none of which told me where to look) where\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just MSWord users griping.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#PVI wrestled Good Council today. Lost, which wasn't unexpected,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we are giving up too many points because we are short wrestlers.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Such is life, we've got a good batch of kids though, and its a shame\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they can't have a few wins under their belt. Michael lost, but he\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#didn't show that lost and discouraged look after being taken down\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that has cost him so many matches. Definite improvement.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Smithsonian is picking on one of their researchers\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for allowing an Intelligent Design article into a peer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#review journal. Remember, keeping such things out is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#***huge*** part of the materialist defense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against such ideas. Rather than just debate them on the merits,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#keep them out of journals and then tell the world that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lack of such articles means it isn't "real science." Details are [here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on arn's news blog](http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/3/2005/01/29/the_branding_of_a_heretic_are_religious_)
