"[Council\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rejects transfer of monument, property](http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20050309-9999-7n9cross.html)" reports that atheists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have struck again against Christianity in the public sphere.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This time, regrettably, more successfully. This case seems,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to me, very similar to the pair currently in the US Supreme\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court. David Limbaugh alerted me to this article in his post, "[San\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Diego City Council Orders Cross Removed](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/san_diego_city.html)." As he says, I highly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#doubt our founding fathers would have intended any such thing.
