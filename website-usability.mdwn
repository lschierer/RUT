I was reading [Joel On Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/30.html " A Minor Redesign") again today, and decided to follow some of the same advice that Joel is in his recent site revamp. I am not going quite so far as he has, nor fully implementing the usability guides he links to. But I am making a little more effort, and to that end, you will now see a blurb in the side bar about me and this site. You may also have noted that the links started to have tooltips a little while ago. I might implement a little more of this at some future point.
