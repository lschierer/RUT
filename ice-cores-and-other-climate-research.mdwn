No one really disagrees with the conclusion: our climate is changing with time. The disagreement starts when you start speculating about causes of the change, extents of the change, and the impact of the change.

With that in mind, I introduce two articles I recently read on the topic. First, the more extreme one, coming from the United Kingdom of all places.^[[1]](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/04/09/do0907.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/04/09/ixworld.html\ "There\ IS\ a\ problem\ with\ global\ warming...\ it\ stopped\ in\ 1998")^ It claims that global warming stopped in 1998, that from then until our current measurements in 2005, you see a statistical change of zero, despite the more extreme weather we have experienced. I have no clue how accurate his figures are. I have no doubt that scientists on both sides would, if asked, rush down paths of explanation that have mroe in common with dogmaticism than with science. In defense of this article though, it is not the first time I have read about the rise and fall of the temperatures being divorced from the rise and fall of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

The second comes from this side of the Atlantic, [MichNews](http://www.michnews.com), and does not challenge the idea of rising temperatures.^[[2]](http://www.michnews.com/artman/publish/article_12240.shtml\ "Ice\ Cores\ Show\ Sun,\ Not\ Humans,\ Controlling\ Earth's\ Climate")^ In that sense, Mr. Avery is much more mainstream, but then he departs from scientific orthodoxy. He claims that the ice cores scientists have collected demonstrate a 1500-year warming cycle that operates within the 100,000 year ice age cycle. Moreover, he claims that this cycle happens independently of human influence.

In my own course work in grade school and highschool, I was presented with the idea that Greenland's name comes to us as the remnaints of the biggest marketing scam ever. This article embrases a very different idea and claims as support archeological evidence. It claims that Greenland may in fact have been *green*, that is, it may have been habitable and hospitable before a climate change plunged it back into glacier. I find this theory more compelling myself.

Together, the look at the dissonance between the years of greatest warming and the years of greatest pollution and the evidence of the ice cores, we look at a picture in which the scare of global warming is just that: a scare. Very ready to blame Western Civilization for the world's problems, claims that we are responsible for the destruction of the world's climate quite easily prove a source for ready funding. And disagreement with this orthodoxy would then bring an end of funding, as well as social death as the intrepid scientist's pears feel umbrage at being challenged, their livelihood threatened.
