#+TITLE: Sharks swim to live

So not only do salmon shark have to keep swimming so as to avoid sinking, they need to do so to avoid freezing as well.^[[1]](http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=104543&org=NSF&from=news\ "How\ Hot\ Tuna\ (and\ Some\ Sharks)\ Stay\ Warm")^ Apparently doing so (swimming) helps it maintain its temperature. Very cool.
