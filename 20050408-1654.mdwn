Someone's blog, I believe\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a Debian developer's, pointed me at
a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/\_/id/7203633?pageid=
"\>this rant. My first thought is that I wonder if he has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#actually read Thomas Gold's *The Deep Hot Bioshpere*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For a short synopsis of how this book relates, see [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#page](http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/recharging/).

Beyond that though, he makes, I think, more good points than bad.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Suburbia will be a **BAD** place to be if the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#availability of gasoline and diesel fuel were to be substantially\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reduced for a prolonged period of time, something he takes as a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#given. The cities would naturally also be a very bad place to be,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but that is a given. I do disagree however with his opinion that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more liberal parts of the country, the northwest and northeast, will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be the best off. He sees a conflict of arms in the "Bible belt."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So do I in fact, but such a conflict would be short lived, versus the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wide-spread death from cold, lack of food, lack of adequate shelter.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Southern culture handled the widespread availability and use of arms\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before the industrialized era, it would do so again. For perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a generation, you would see violence as people band together to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#protect their own, but the very deep rooted southern culture that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he sees as the spark of this violence would also be its control as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the code of gentlemanly conduct re-asserts itself more strongly.

For all the flaws of such a life, flaws I touched on in my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#previous post, there are also some areas where it is subject to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#much less confusion. Gender roles are clear: while some women are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#stronger than some men, the reverse is *far* more generally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the case, and this leads to a logical division of labor absent the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#equalizing mechanical aids. mmmm. I need to clarify here, as the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Africans do not universally follow the European model here, and some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other cultures might not either. The stereotypical hunter/gatherer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#society has women doing all the hard, backbreaking labor while men\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#laze around and hunt some. There are reasons for this as well, some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of which are good and some of which are bad, but it is not what we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here, or the south specifically, would return to. Oh, you would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#see some cases of that, you did before, but no one who was well\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#respected. You have surely heard the phrase "white trash"â€¦\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#well, men who fail to fulfill their responsibility is part of that.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pulling myself back on track here, we would revert to the farming\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#culture of our earlier years, where the man farms with his wife,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he primarily taking care of the fields and animals, and she the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#house and animals. Fully fair to neither, this yet had more to say\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for it than we do now, I think (limited to gender related topics)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where we are lost in a confusion, where masculinity is universally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#denigrated, and our goal is an androgynous society. Ugh.
