In her [recent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/monacharen/mc20050422.shtml), Mona Charen praises John Bolton for his work in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#defeating the "Zionism is Racism" United Nations resolution.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But step back and think about this for a second. The Israelis\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are not just persecuting the Arab population in their borders.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#While from the media reports it often seems that all Palestinians are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Muslim, a good many of them are Christian (most of the Christians are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in fact Catholic, but that is a side point). And the Israelis are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#making life *incredibly* difficult for them also. Did you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#know that you cannot have a Catholic tour guide in Israel? Only a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Jew may have the job title "Tour Guide"[1]. So the Palestinian\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholics who act as guides for the shrines, monasteries, and other\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#holy sites in the care of the Franciscans go by the title "Pilgrimage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#animator". And that only after the Franciscans closed their doors\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to everyone (thus preventing the Jewish "Tour Guides" from having\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anywhere to give tours) forced the Israeli government to come to that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"compromise." The Jewish government wants an all-Jewish state just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as much as the Muslim population wants an all-Muslim Middle East.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So which is better really? Good question, the only clear answer is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that we created Israel, and in doing so put them in harm's way, so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we have some responsibility to help protect them from that harm.
