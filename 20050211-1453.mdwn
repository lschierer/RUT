I found "[Kan.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Woman Resumes Talking After 20 Years](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20050211/ap_on_re_us/recovering_woman)" from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[David\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Limbaugh's blog](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/) post entitled "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mysteries of Life](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/02/the_mysteries_o.html)." He made the same association I would have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#myself on reading the article, that it is remarkably similar to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#findings I mentioned [here](./view.php?date=20050208-1101)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in which there are some signs that even unresponsive patients are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#still aware of their surroundings. Just goes to show you once again,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that we need to be **incredibly** wary not to devalue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#human life at any stage or in any condition, but rather always give\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#God room and time to choose to act.
