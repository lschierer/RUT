Mr. Pat Buchanan comes to the Church's defense today, defending\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Pius XII against claims that Pope Pius\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#XII failed to assist the Jews during the Holocaust or was tactically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#complicit in it.[1] He does so quoting, of all things, the New York\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Times, hardly a fan of Catholicism. He also quotes a number of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Jewish leaders from that era, all of whom uniformly praise Pope Pius\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#XII, and thank him for his efforts. It is expected that the world\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will hate the Church, and will distort her history and efforts.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That is why it is so important that we who are Catholic know and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learn the truth.
