I sit down at my computer, and I see Ederlyn online tonight for the first time in ages. I wonder if she's been online before recently and had me blocked, or if this is the first she's been online in ages (when I've been around at least). I do not ask. I said in the email to her when I first noticed myself banned from her journal that I would leave her alone. I will keep my word.

I do miss her and Joe though. I fear that I have lost them from my life for my stupidity.
