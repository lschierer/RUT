#+TITLE: Poison Ivy

I somehow managed to get poison ivy across my left check and nose. I think I picked it up on the meandering walk home from St. Veronica's that Lauren and I took Tuesday night. If not then, it must be in Mom's garden somewheres. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is only very mildly itchy, but it is managing to significantly annoy me anyway. I put some cortisone cream stuff on at Lauren's a few hours ago, but it only really helped for a few minutes. Not worth it. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\*grumbles\*
