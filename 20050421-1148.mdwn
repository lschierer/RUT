John Leo [asks](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/johnleo/jl20050418.shtml)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a very good question: "Do we really need yet another major assault\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on a prominent politician, or can we spend some time discussing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#actual issues?" He rightly points out that we only tend to object\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to such attacks when they are against someone we mostly agree with.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But he seems to lump together the attack of the Swift Boat Veterans\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against John Kerry with the democratic comparisons of President Bush\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the Nazi regime. To me, these seem like incredibly different\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#things. John Kerry unquestionably misrepresented his involvement\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the Vietnam War. The Swift Boat Veterans called him on this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#attacked him for his duplicity, and for his record then and since.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is a necessary part of political debate. Do you want someone\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who routinely lies to you as your president? Someone fervently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against the military as Commander in Chief during a time of conflict\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(unjustifiable conflict perhaps, but that is a different issue, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are in it and need to finish it right)? Should we not have access\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the truths of the candidate's positions and record? These seem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fairly self-evident questions. Conversely, what new information does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the comparison of President Bush to the Nazis add to the debate?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If you hate his policies, attack them. If you think he really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#did lie about the situation in Iraq, present your evidence for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that assertion. Should Tom DeLay have called the ruling to remove\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mrs. Schivao's feeding tube "medical terrorism"? No, probably not.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It was a hyperbolic statement of the sort that politicians should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be careful of. Should he have come down strongly and publicly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against it? Should he be working for judicial reform if he thinks\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that represents an abuse? Absolutely. Should he campaign for support\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for that reform? Yes, he should. Does the fact that some now (and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would otherwise still) send death threats to Judge Greer stop him?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#No, it shouldn't. Fanatics and extremists, insanity of all sorts,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#looms in any extreme position, and thus in any issue. We must not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#let that stop us from seeking to move forward. And we cannot allow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#deceitful politicians impede that progress by misrepresentation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of themselves and their positions either.
