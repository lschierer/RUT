#+TITLE: To split or not to split, that is the question

It appears the Anglican church is still struggling with the decision of the American and Canadian branch(es) to have an openly gay bishop and to bless homosexual unions.[1] It is interesting that even the "traditionalists" are speaking of this in terms of "practice and discipline" when it really comes down to a matter of doctrine. But the Anglican church *would* have trouble with that one, after all, they split over a matter of doctrine, the primacy of the Pope. ;-)
