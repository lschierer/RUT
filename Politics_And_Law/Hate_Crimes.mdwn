[This story from the LSU Reveille][lsur1] also mentioned [here in Michelle
Malkin's web log][mmc1] brings up a very good question.  Why is it only a hate
crime if it is committed against some hip minority?  Why is it not a hate crime
to vandalize the crosses used in this Christian protest?  Why are Christians not
eligible for toleration by those who disagree with us?
