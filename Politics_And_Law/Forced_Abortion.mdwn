"A Nevada state judge says he has the authority to order an abortion for a pregnant 32-year-old mentally disabled woman."[^20121110-1]  The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com) does not say how the issue landed in court at all, but from Mr. Wesley J. Smith's post on the topic, it appears that county officials want to take over care of the girl.[^20121110-2] A judge should have no authority to tell anyone they must have an abortion.  In the case of a mentally disabled person, a judge should not have the authority to tell her parents she must either.  This brings a new light on the subject of voting in local elections, where usually it can be difficult to find out what the candidates think on the national issues, like abortion.  If, however, county officials are going to start pushing abortions on people, we will have to start asking local candidates to put a stop to it.
