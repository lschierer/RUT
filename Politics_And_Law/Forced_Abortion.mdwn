"A Nevada state judge says he has the authority to order an abortion for a pregnant 32-year-old mentally disabled woman."[^20121110-1]  The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com) does not say how the issue landed in court at all, and to my mind, if, as the article says, the woman's parents are her legal guardians, it should not be in court at all.  A judge should have no authority to tell anyone they must have an abortion.  In the case of a mentally disabled person, a judge should not have the authority to tell her parents she must either.
