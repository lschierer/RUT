#+TITLE: The Great Scare debunked

There has always been something fishy to my mind about the idea of man causing Global Warming. This has often caused me to doubt the concept itself. Both doubts find more justification than I could have ever hoped for in a recent article^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^ in the Telegraph, a United Kingdom paper. Not only does he call the United Nations, a suspect body if ever there was one, he provides his sources and his math.^[\\[2\\]][ref2]^ That way the mathematically inclined can verify his conclusions. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#To which (his conclusions) I can only say "wow." Repeatedly. I sincerely wish the copyright notice on the Telegraph allowed the same unlimited reproduction with credit that TheFactIs does. I would so love to post, and thus preserve, this entire article. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
