Mr. Chuck Colson is aware of some of the research behind something\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I have been saying for some time: homosexuality is a disease.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In the face of John Hopkins University's decision to offer sex\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#change operations in the 1970s, Mr. Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#attempted to redeem his profession by questioning the wisdom of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this operation. He found that the operation, while not regretted,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#did nothing to help with the varied mental problems that led to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#request. He concluded "that Hopkins was fundamentally cooperating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with a mental illness."[1] He also studied the cases of baby boys\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who had been made to appear physically as girls when born with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"ambiguous genitals."[1] Such children did *not* grow up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as happy well adjusted girls, but "endured 'prolonged distress\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and misery.' When they discovered their true genetic heritage,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#most of them began to live as males."[1]

This does not directly counter the beetle research I posted about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a while back, but it does demonstrate that there *are*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fundamental differences between boys and girls, and that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexuality can, in at least some cases, be cured.
