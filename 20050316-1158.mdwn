"[Critically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ill baby dies after being removed from life support in Texas](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51//03-15-2005/e08c00071b19f550.html)"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#should horrify you. It should horrify you that it has happened\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at all. It should horrify you even more that it has happened here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the United States. Doctors can now, in Texas at least, override\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#your wishes about your children's health, and what medical treatment\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they receive. A doctor can decide that efforts to preserve your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#life are "useless" and let you die sooner and faster. How long until\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we start defining down "useless" efforts and "worthless" lives?
