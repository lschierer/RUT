<p>It's just a matter of seeking arguments from both sides. If you look carefully, you'll find how the "disproof" of evolution is misleading and how the "evidence" of a Creator is not as certain as it could seem. Here are two interesting examples:</p>

<p>http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/paul_doland/creator.html
http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/probability-one.html</p>

<p>This discussion reminds me of the Torah Code. A lot of people find it so amazing that it's possible to find words related to the same topic in a same, "small" region of the bible, and that the probability of having that is so low (5 to 6 sigma, a really impressive number when dealing with probability), that it <em>must</em> have been intentional, therefore proving the existence of the code. They forget or ignore, though, that (1) Hebrew is particularly open to multiple spellings of a same word, (2) it has no vowels when written and (3) the bible is long enough to make such probabilities possible. The proof of that is that the same experiment can be repeated over Hebrew versions of "War and Peace" and "Moby Dick", with even better results.</p>

<p>I mention that because the root of both discussions is the same: probability.</p>
