<p>I can predict the objection I am going to get.  You do not have enough time, enough generations, even given an old Earth.  Modern humans go back at least 150,000 years.  Modern evidence also shrinks the amount of time available to go from no life to your basic single celled organism.  Even with an old Earth, you do not have anywhere near enough time or generations.</p>
