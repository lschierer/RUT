<p>The age of the universe really doesn't help you.  You need the <em>Earth</em> to be FAR FAR older than <em>anyone</em> predicts it is. You need to go from a single cell (I'll even go so far as to grant you that the first cell might have been seeded by a comet or similar) to the diversity of life we see now.</p>

<p>You do not have 10 to 20 billion years for this to happen in.  If the mutation you need to step forward <em>on earth</em> happened on some other planet in some other galaxy, it does you absolutely no good.</p>

<p>On the cosmology side of things, the numbers get mind-bogglingly big very very fast.  I do not think that the numbers you give really produce any meaningful likelihood of Earth developing.  The conditions for Earth really are that rare.  You think they do.  I doubt we could get anywhere arguing that.</p>
