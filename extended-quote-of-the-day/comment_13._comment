<p>While searching for references about the book, I stumbled upon this nice synthesis:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Evolution
Apparently, this book (or the idea behind it?) is very close to the Torah Code analogy I made before: misused probability allied to ignoring relevant contradictory facts equals public amusement, but not necessarily a scientific discovery. In other words, it seems to be closer to conspiracy theories such as "We Never Went To The Moon" than "The Universe in a Nutshell". Again, I wouldn't suggest taking that book as reference without examining the replies. Anyway, it was a very interesting debate. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. And to think I found it by accident while reading the Pidgin news...</p>
