A while back,[1] I mentioned that Pat Buchanan is advocating a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#return to isolationism. One of my primary objections was that it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simply has not worked all that well in the past, we ended up fighting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#World War I and, because of the disastrous treaty ending that war,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#World War II. Mr. Buchanan, as if he could hear my objections\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(perhaps others expressed them as well?), has a new article[2]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#asking how much of a "victory" World War II was. He asks some very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#good questions, but I think some of his premises are wrong. While he\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#may be right that France and Britain drew Hitler into western Europe,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that we joined the war to drive him out, I am certain that was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not the *right* reason, if it was our reason, to go to war\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with Hitler. The *right* reason to go to war with Hitler\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was because he was unacceptably evil. The *right* reason\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was to end the Holocaust, to end his persecution of the Church,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and to end his reign of death and terror over the elderly, infirm,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and disabled.

Unfortunately, Mr. Buchanan's questions make *even more*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sense in this context than in his own. Because while we *did*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#stop Hitler (late, but at least we did), we turned half of Europe\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#over to Stalin and the Communists, who initiated a similar reign of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#death and terror. It makes me sympathize even more with Generals\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Paton and MacArthur who did not see the war as over, and wanted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to take on the communists in China and Russia then, when we were\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#already mobilized and fighting. Would we have won? On both fronts? I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do not know. But I think it would have been right to have tried.
