#+TITLE: A good movie

I watched part of [Bicentenial Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182789/) this evening. It is amazing at times how much a good book or a good movie can brighten a day. I figure since I am paying for cable, I might as well use it. The commercials are annoying though, and I notice the missing bits of movie in places.
