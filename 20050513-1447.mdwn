I read today of a little girl who does not age. This seems, at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the surface, to be something that people would dream of, imagine not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#getting old â€¦ not getting older than six to twelve months.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This little girl, now twelve *years* old, has no language\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#skills, but can crawl across a floor, or pull herself up in her crib.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Doctors have no clue what is wrong with her, and she has suffered\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from all sorts of other things: "strokes, seizures, ulcers, severe\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#respiratory problems and a tumor the size of a lemon." Pray for her,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and her family.
