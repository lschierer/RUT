#+TITLE: "Young People" understand absolutes

In a report that would never make the news here in the United States, Reuters India has a story about how they have found that many "young people" (the vagueness of that demographic annoys me slightly) support the Church's teaching on sexuality, and understand the importance of *having* absolutes even when many fail to follow them.[[1]](http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2005-08-18T195922Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-213095-1.xml) This is an important story, and its a shame that its not being carried more widely.
