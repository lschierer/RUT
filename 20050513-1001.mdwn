The federal courts are starting to weigh in on the homosexual\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"marriage" debate, with unfortunately predictable results. A federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#judge in Nebraska has struck down that state's Constitutional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Amendment to ban such false marriages, claiming it goes too far and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is too broad in its restrictions on what the state of Nebraska may\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#recognize.[1][2] This sort of action highlights the need to Amend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Federal Constitution. Ideally this would not be necessary,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but we have come to accept that the federal government can preempt\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the state laws and constitutions wherever it so desires. Once it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was a given that a state could set up a state religion, that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Federal Constitutional ban on that did not preclude state action.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In fact, I am fairly sure that such things happened in New England.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Now, we find ourselves protected from that, yet, by virtue of that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"protection," at risk of seeing religion and morality baned from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#public sphere entirely by the same reading of the Constitution.
