#+TITLE: Curious reaction to disbelief

It must be really very comforting to be able to dismiss everyone who disagrees with you as uneducated. "Oh, he must be \*ignorant\*, or stupid, not to believe in global warming." It is certainly far easier than actually questioning your assumptions. Today I read that the chief economist for Chrysler thinks that Europeans are being a little bit hysterical in their approach to global warming.^[\\[1\\]][ref1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The\ article\ starts\ with\ a\ brief\ summery\ of\ where\ Mr.\ Jolissaint\ (the\ Chrysler\ employee\ in\ question)\ was\ speaking,\ and\ what\ he\ said.\ It\ concludes\ that\ summary\ with\ "Mr\ Jolissant's\ remarks\ illustrate\ the\ yawning\ gap\ between\ mainstream\ opinion\ on\ climate\ change\ among\ the\ educated\ elites\ of\ Europe\ and\ America."^[\\[2\\]][ref2]^\ The\ implication\ here\ is\ clear:\ Mr.\ Jolissant,\ and\ the\ rest\ of\ the\ United\ States,\ is\ either\ not\ as\ smart\ or\ not\ as\ educated\ as\ those\ who\ believe\ in\ global\ warming.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The\ rest\ of\ the\ article,\ roughly\ half\ its\ length,\ is\ on\ an\ entirely\ unrelated\ set\ of\ topics.\ It\ is\ talking\ about\ the\ track\ record\ of\ economists\ from\ the\ General\ Motors,\ Ford\ and\ DaimlerChrysler\ in\ \*economy\*.\ Apparently,\ if\ you\ failed\ to\ predict\ the\ extent\ of\ the\ rise\ in\ gas\ prices,\ or\ the\ slow\ down\ in\ the\ United\ States\ economy,\ you\ \*must\*\ be\ wrong\ when\ you\ say\ that\ Europeans\ are\ being\ hysterical.\ This\ sort\ of\ ad-hominem\ attack\ \*always\*\ makes\ a\ logically\ invalid\ argument,\ and\ if\ that\ is\ the\ support\ that\ Mr.\ Schifferes\ thinks\ best\ to\ offer\ as\ a\ refutation\ of\ Mr.\ Jolissant's\ claims,\ we\ must\ consider\ that\ perhaps\ it\ is\ because\ Europeans\ \*are\*\ being\ "quasi-hysterical."\ \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#^
