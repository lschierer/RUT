I really do not know where to start with [this](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050509-4886.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ars article. It is rightly concerned with so much, it is quite\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#obviously biased and wrong about almost as much.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The article starts off more or less correctly, it is a surprise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the REAL ID Act is getting next to no coverage. And it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#obvious that it has been attached to this military spending bill\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because there is no way the Congress, either house, could pass it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without backlash (how big a backlash is another question, but there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would be backlash) otherwise. For this reason, Mr. Bruce Schneier [says](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/05/real_id.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the REAL ID Act is a done deal, that there is no way it will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fail.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
As to the national id aspect of the bill, Mr. Schneier's web log\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#entry is rather more informative, accurate, and meaningful than Ars'\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is. Either way, it is a significant concern. You *do not*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#want this bill to pass if you value your privacy *at all*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Or, at least, not if you value your privacy and your freedom more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than you value your sheep-like security (yes, you can see *my*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bias here). Mrs. Michelle Malkin is likely in favor of this bill,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#she will see the security concerns without really noting that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proposed solution is not an adequate fix. Others significantly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#upset about illegal immigration will also likely support this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as they will see its denial of licenses to illegal immigrants.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#However well or poorly Ars and Mr. Schneier argue on this aspect\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#however, I think they have missed stating the vital point.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The argument against this aspect of the bill, the immigration\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#aspect, is the same as that against gun control. Illegal aliens\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will still drive, they just will not have licenses, and thus will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not have even the minimal testing that the various departments of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#motor vehicles offer. To what extent is that already the case?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is hard to say, but it must be less when you can know someone\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with a license than when every illegal immigrant lacks one.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Moving on, we get to judicial review. I find it really curious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that Ars can quote the relevant section of the Constitution\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and yet still find that judicial review is yet part of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Constitution. If it is, I do not see it. As best I remember\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from my history and government courses, judicial review started\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with *Marbury v. Madison*, when it first struck down a bill\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as unconstitutional. This ability itself is not enumerated in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Constitution, but was not challenged at the time, by the men who had\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#written the Constitution, so it may be assumed that they consented\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to it as being compatible. At least, if they did challenge it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#such challenge has not lasted to my ears.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Living as they did in a time when tyranny was primarily\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#imposed by the executive, the governors of the separate colonies\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#disbanding the legislatures, overriding the courts, interfering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with them, it is not surprising that rather fewer checks were\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#put on the Courts by our founding fathers than on the executive.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Interestingly though, argument *has* been passed down to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us of several early presidents, including Madison, widely held\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be the primary author of the Constitution (unlike Jefferson,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#author of the Declaration, who was not even involved directly),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#criticizing Congress for passing bills beyond their Constitutional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#authority, and vetoing said bills. An example being a pension for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#widows of military officers. If Congress had not the authority to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pass a pension for the widows of military officers, where comes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the authority for it to pension for us all (Social Security)?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Now likely, the Federal pension plans, being as they are passed as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#part of the compensation due to Federal employees are different, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#under such, Congress may then have been able to pass that pension\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#plan, but it did so as an act of humanity, not under its ability\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to pass laws necessary (I.E. paying government employees) to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exercise of the Government's function. Returning to my point here,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our founding fathers feared many forms of tyranny, they saw the threat\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of democracy, they saw the abuse of the executive. I think however\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that they missed the possibly tyranny of the oligarchy, the tyranny\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the unchecked judicial power could, and now is, making.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Ars certainly misses this possibility. Concerned that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#separation of Church and State, itself not "constitutionally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mandated" but rather an erroneous decision of the Warren Court that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has been imposed on us by the courts since, might be eroded, Ars is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up in arms over the possibility that Congress might use the Article\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#3 Section 2 clause 2 powers to restrict the scope of the courts.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
In part, they are rightly concerned. Such a restriction\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#might now serve good ends, it could be used to limit the damage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to society by the decisions of Massachusetts and similar states.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It could be used to prevent the ACLU and other rabidly anti-Christian\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#organizations from further erasing our Christian heritage from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#collective consciousness. These would be good acts, good ends at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#least, possibly, but debatably, good means to them. It could also,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at some point in the future, be used quite the reverse, it could be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#used to restrict the Courts from enforcing the freedom of religion,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for example. It is a two edged sword, quite capable of cutting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#both ways, just as the filibuster is (which is why the democrats\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and republicans have switched sides on the filibuster recently,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is now the democrats wielding the sword, not the republicans).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, I think that in this case, like in many others, that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Article 3 Section 2 clause 2 powers are simply a tool, a tool that,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unlike for example nuclear weapons, have no inherent good or evil\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#content, they are more like a hammer, which can be used for good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and evil, so it is the intent of the person, the act for which it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is used, that determines the morality of the use (again, unlike\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nuclear arms, which cannot be legitimately used (except perhaps as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a threat? but a threat implies that they might be, and they must\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not beâ€¦messy question)).
