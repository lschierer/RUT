In his typical way, Walter Williams has given one of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the best refutations of the whole mess surrounding the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#president of Harvard saying that there may be innate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#differences between men and women that may account\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for the discrepancy in their math and science scores. In "[Anti-intellectualism\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#among the academic elite](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20050202.shtml)," he compares this to the disparities\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that follow race lines in health and athletics; how sickle cell\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anemia occurs mostly in black people, Tay-Sachs disease mostly in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#easter European Jews. He goes on to use swimming and running in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Olympics to hammer home his point. Really people, do we need\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to let politics and ideology get in the way of realizing the truth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that people are *different* and that there is nothing wrong\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with that, it doesn't take away from their humanity or dignity,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we just need to accept it, adjust to it, and move on.
