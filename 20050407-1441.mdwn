I found [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rather irate article/post](http://www.reformationtestimony.org.nz/Essays2/Pontifex%20Maximus.htm) off of Ederlyn's blog. I have read\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about such people more than once, but never seen a real example\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of it before. Someone who really considers the pope to be "the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#man of sin." While I agree that it is rather silly for Mrs. Bush\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and Ms. Rice to be wearing veils the way a devote Catholic might\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(which is not to say that every female who doe not is not devote,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I simply mean that the ones who do tend to be), I think he is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being more than a little prideful and/or deliberately obtuse not to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#realize that we kneel in prayer to God *for* the Pope John\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Paul II, not *to* him. However, protestants, and especially\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#evangelicals, fail to understand our communion with the saints,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the conversation we hold with them, asking their intersession\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before Christ for us, so I guess it is not too much of a stretch\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to see this cluelessness.

On a side note, this article provides some timely proof that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Separation of Church and State" here in the United States has been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#badly perverted. Do you think Washington or Madison intended that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the President should not be able to kneel in Church?
