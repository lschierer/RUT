Mr. Pat Buchanan, it seems, cannot be satisfied. If President Bush *did* raise troop levels, he would be certain to be stabbed in the back by the likes of Mr. Buchanan, who has been been very vocal in his advocacy of a isolationist policy. But, having maintained troop levels, President Bush is *still* bashed by Mr. Buchanan, this time for not doing in enough.[1] Atleast Mr. Buchanan seems to have realized that we cannot pull out now, having started this mess.
