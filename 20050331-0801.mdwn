I find it rather ironic that I posted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about cyborgs only yesterday considering [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4396387.stm). Scientists have now developed a way to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#implant a computer chip such that the brain can control it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it can read some "brain waves," and let you control electrical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#devices. Examples include TV power, channel, and volume.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They hope to extend this to allow paralyzed to move again. "[Meet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the mind readers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1448140,00.html)" goes into further details on this idea,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#apparently there have been some successes along these lines.
