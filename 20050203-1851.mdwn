Okay, so that was odd. Turns out Mom's problem with email was that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it wasn't actually sending it, **and** thunderbird\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wasn't telling her that it was not sending. At some unknown point\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the past when our ip address changed, and my server stopped\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#forwarding mail for the house, thunderbird didn't start popping up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#error messages as it normally does. Very odd. So I upgraded her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thunderbird version from something to 1.0, and then resent all her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#email from the 24th on, since the last she remembers getting replies\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was the 22nd (and apparently she didn't send anything on the 23rd).
