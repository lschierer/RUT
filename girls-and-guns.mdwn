[Continuing](https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050406-1141/20050406-1141 "20050406-1141") [a habit](https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20051021-1615/second-amendment-factoids "Second Amendment factoids") of noting statistics and figures for use against those who would support gun control, I present you with the idea that a gun is better defense against a robbery attempt than passive behavior.^[[1]](http://www.townhall.com/blogs/c-log/Dan%20Mitchell/story/2006/01/14/182435.html\ "Gun\ ownership\ especially\ important\ for\ women")^ Specifically, "women who used a gun to resist an attack were 2.5 times more likely to escape uninjured than those who behaved passively."^[[2]](http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23643/pub_detail.asp\ "A\ Girl's\ Guide\ to\ Guns")^ And that statistic that you are more likely to shoot yourself or a family member than an attacker? It included suicides to come up with that statement.
