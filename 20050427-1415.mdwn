[This\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#development](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/04-27-2005/2d820007bc101f2d.html) in California is rather disturbing. Any bill to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#legalize homosexual "marriage" is disturbing of course, but this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one is beyond that. This one really does show the extent that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these activists will go to force us to accept their immorality.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#According to the article, the California state constitution does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not allow the legislature to modify statues that were passed by\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#referendum. In 2000, just the sort of definition of a marriage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as being between a man and a woman that other states have made\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#constitutional amendments was passed by sixty-one percent of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the California electorate. So this new bill allowing homosexual\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"marriages" is rather blatantly unconstitutional.
