On the Pro-Life front, the Netherlands continues to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incredibly depressing, incredibly permeated by the culture of death.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Michelle Malkin notes[1] that up to 28 percent of Dutch doctors\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would follow a *child's* request to die over the wishes of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the child's parents. So apparently a child is competent to have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an abortion, competent to choose to die, but not competent for his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or her own criminal actions. Does anyone else see the falsity of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the logic here?

Also in Pro-Life news, we have the story of a little baby named\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Hope."[2] She is alive and in the care of the state because of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#North Carolina's "Safe Surrender Act" which allows a mother to leave\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her child with any responsible adult without being questioned and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without fear of prosecution. The idea here is to prevent children\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from being killed or abandoned (much the same result most of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time) by parents who are unable or unwilling to care for them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Instead, under this law, they can be turned over to the state,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which will attempt to find and contact the father (to see if he\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is willing to take on his responsibility for the child), and then,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if the father consents (the article does not state what happens if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he cannot be found), the child is put up for adoption.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
As little in favor of state intervention in the family as I am,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think this a good law. I see it in the light of babies that have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been found left in bathrooms, alleys, and dumpsters. I see it in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#light of babies found dead, killed by their parents. I see it as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a state desperately battling to save some of the most defenseless\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of its citizens from death at the hands of those who will not or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot do their duty to the child they have brought into the world.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Further, this is not a state mandated intervention, it must be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#initiated by the mother, and the state does give the father a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#chance to exercise his responsibility. Thus I think this may even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be a wholly positive measure. But, mother-initiated as it is,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and as it does not involve the death of anyone, but rather holds\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the hope of adoption and life with a loving family for the child,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even if it is not wholly positive, I strongly suspect that it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worth the cost (though it is of course impossible to state that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with certainty while the cost is unknown).

Next we have the story of Kalea Lyn Allen, in Oklahoma.[3]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This amazingly small 11 ounce baby was born ***three\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#months*** premature. Further, even at that minuscule\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#size, she is not the smallest known living baby. A little girl born\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in Chicago at 8.6 ounces is thought to be that. The littlest girl,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#born in September, was released from the hospital in February,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and thus represents a miraculous success story. That in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#face of law makers that would allow third trimester abortions.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That in the face of those who would allow *any* abortions.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For once this would have been called impossible, yet now these\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#babies are born, nurtured, and live. Little Miss Allen has a 40\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#percent survival chance right now, she is being kept alive in a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#plastic tent, with her eyes covered, a tiny little oxygen tube, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#presumably some kind of intravenous food source, as her intestines\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and kidneys are underdeveloped. Pray for both children.
