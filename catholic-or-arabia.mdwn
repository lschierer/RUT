Something that has been sitting on my desk for a while now, waiting for me to decide to write about it. We have got a serious problem here with regards to the idea of "same sex marriage." Earlier this month, [TheFactIs](http://www.thefactis.org) writer Ms. Samantha Singson wrote about the disturbingly real possibility that the European Union will be used as a mechanism to force Europe further into moral and social decline, by penalizing those nations that refuse to legalize these "marriages."^[[1]](http://www.thefactis.org/default.aspx?control=ArticleMaster&aid=1532&authid=11\ "New\ EU\ Law\ Forces\ Homosexual\ 'Marriage'\ on\ All\ Member\ States")^ Normally, I would quote the entire article verbatim, as their copyright notice permits it, but I want to move on today. So I will just quote the first two paragraphs, containing the bulk of the legalese.

> A new law may force nations in the European Union to accept same-sex unions from other nations. The European Free Movement Directive entered into legal force last week and it requires EU member states to grant residency to homosexuals who are not citizens if their partner is a citizen of an EU country.
> 
> The directive grants family reunification rights to same-sex partners when one of the partners resides in an EU country that gives legal recognition to same-sex unions. But EU countries without same-sex marriage or partnership laws are not let off the hook. Though not automatically required to give legal recognition to same-sex unions such nations are obligated under the new law to perform an investigation into the stability of same-sex couples seeking reunification rights. If a relationship is deemed "real and durable," then national authorities are required to facilitate entry and residence for the gay partner who is a non-citizen.^[[1]](http://www.thefactis.org/default.aspx?control=ArticleMaster&aid=1532&authid=11\ "New\ EU\ Law\ Forces\ Homosexual\ 'Marriage'\ on\ All\ Member\ States")^

The article continues, and she provides some quotes that illustrate but fall short of proof that this is aimed at forcing the issue of same sex "marriage" in those countries where marriage is still understood.
This is the sort of "European Union" that exists now, and this the sort of action that those in support of it favor. It is decidedly anti-Catholic in nature, supported by those who hate orthodox Catholicism.

Yes, I am wording that strongly. Today, catching up on some of the recent Planet Debian posts, I find a doozie. Mr. Christian Perrier uses language just as strong as my own, and identically targeted, for he is one who supports this union.^[[2]](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2006/05/06#poland\ "Poland\ turning\ right\ hardly")^ Lest the necessity of the link be missed, he reiterated it later.^[[2]](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2006/05/07#right-wing\ "Right\ wing\ or\ not?")^

Mr. Perrier thinks that Europe will "outgrow" Catholicism (my word, but it fits his ideas). I think that if Europe does not grow up and rediscover Catholicism, it will cease to be. It will become part of Arabia.
