<p>Apparently the marijuana users <em>did</em> argue that there was
no interstate commerce involved here.[1] They grew their own.
Thus there was no <em>commerce</em> at all here.  However, under an
unnamed Supreme Court ruling 63 years ago (I really need to learn
when the Warren court was, but if I did, I would just forget it,
I am bad with dates), the commerce power extends beyond the true
interstate commerce because "the cumulative effect of even minor and
local economic activities can have interstate consequences."[1] While
I understand the logic here, I am not sure that I agree with its
necessity, and I am fairly certain that I dislike its consequences.
It certainly moves the current decision from being questionable to
being certain.  All told, I think Justice Thomas' words sum things
up well: "If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause,
then it can regulate virtually anything" thus "the federal government
is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers."[1]</p>
