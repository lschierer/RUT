Apparently the marijuana users *did* argue that there was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no interstate commerce involved here.[1] They grew their own.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Thus there was no *commerce* at all here. However, under an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unnamed Supreme Court ruling 63 years ago (I really need to learn\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when the Warren court was, but if I did, I would just forget it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am bad with dates), the commerce power extends beyond the true\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interstate commerce because "the cumulative effect of even minor and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#local economic activities can have interstate consequences."[1] While\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I understand the logic here, I am not sure that I agree with its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#necessity, and I am fairly certain that I dislike its consequences.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It certainly moves the current decision from being questionable to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being certain. All told, I think Justice Thomas' words sum things\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up well: "If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#then it can regulate virtually anything" thus "the federal government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers."[1]
