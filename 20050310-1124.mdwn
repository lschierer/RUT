Ben Shapiro's article, "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#radical homosexual agenda and the destruction of standards](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/bs20050309.shtml),"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#provides a powerful critique of the flaws in the concept of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"tolerance." They basically boil down to the fact that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#immoral and amoral are never satisfied. They keep reaching new\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lows, and insisting we accept those. They keep insisting that I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not only allow their behavior, but accept it as normal, as good,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when I believe it harmful and bad. They demand I accept them and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their beliefs, but do not accept me or mine.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Actively homosexual people should not be discriminated against.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Well and good. We can agree on that. But their behavior is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*not* normal. It is *not* healthy. It is much\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like smoking, a poison that will kill them given time. Kill them\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#spiritually if not physically, and often enough both.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
I am not discriminating against them when I deny them the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ability to marry another of the same sex. I am recognizing the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reality of marriage. It simply is not *possible* for a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"marriage" between two people to be, in fact, a marriage. I am\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not discriminating against them, nor against single parents, when I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#say that ideally a child is raised by a mother and a father who are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#married and who have been married to no one else. People fail, they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are human, and so some couples end up divorced, and surely those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#families, headed by single mothers and single fathers, need our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#prayers, assistance, and support. But the *ideal* remains:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*ideally* the family would not break down; *ideally*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#children would not be abused by parents; *ideally* they would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not be abused at all. *Ideally* they will be raised by a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#loving father and a loving mother who teach them right judgment,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#good morals, a strong faith, and a strong work ethic. And society\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would be better for it.
