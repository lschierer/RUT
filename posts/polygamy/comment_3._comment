Hi! I share your view towards polygamy and the harms it can bring upon a society.

In reference to "Honor Killings", I would like to clarify that this is a practice not at all endorsed, in fact forbidden, by Islam. It is unfortunate that despite this, some muslim countries allow/turn a blind eye on this matter because of cultural issues. I don't have enough knowledge on this, so I would refer the following for more reading:
