<p>This week, as Muslims have rioted, burned, bombed, and closed newspapers in responce to some offensive cartoons, a contrast becomes evident.  So evident that even Mrs. Michelle Malkin, who has helped fuel the fires (more on that in a moment), has noted it.<sup><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004522.htm" title="Catholics Insulted, Peace Reigns">[1]</a></sup>  Ms. Jennifer Siegel writes more on this contrast, expanding on the unjust nature of a comparison of Catholic protests of offensive speach and Muslim protests.<sup><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/7329" title="Catholic Activist: Extremist Comparisons Unfair">[2]</a></sup>  In short, we have been peaceful, while they have not only threatened death and distruction, but have carried out those threats.   If you cannot see a difference there, a hugely significant one, then I submit that you really are not capable of rational discussion.</p>

<p>We do ourselves no favors however, either in a push to advance free speach nor in a push for conversion, when we fan the flames of Muslim militancy as Mrs. Malkin has done.  Mr. Alejandro Bermudez explains why.<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/blog/?p=108" title="Don’t get too exited about Muslim bashing">[3]</a></sup>  Any attack on religion, any religion, as a religion is a threat to all of us.  The same papers in which these cartoons originated are equally well known for attacking Catholics.  Further, to replublish these cartoons is not going to help convince Muslims to be less violent, nor is it going to help convert them to the true faith.  This is not an example of evangelization nor of apologetics.  It is simply attacking a religion for no reason other than the fact that that faith is an easy target right now.</p>

<p>While we clearly cannot give in to threats of violence, we also should not be eager to spread these cartoons.  We should find other ways to encourage free speach in the face of this attack on it.  For the surpression of these cartoons is equally unproductive, done in the manner currently attempted.  Far from a peaceful protest aimed at demonstrating the poor logic of publishing them, these attacks are aimed at silencing <em>all</em> critisim and <em>all</em> dissent.  This was not an effective tatic durring the age of the Inquisition, nor is it effective now.  A boycot or a peaceful protest works by reminding publishers where their money comes from.  It does not make economic sense to offend your customer base.  It makes them remember you and your concerns without fearing you or hating you.  A death threat or a bomb threat can also work, in the sense that you can stop publishers from publishing, but you do so by making them fear and hate you.  You convince them of the truth of the material you surpress even as you surpress it.  This means that, in the long run, more of that material will be produced.  It will just be distributed differently.</p>
