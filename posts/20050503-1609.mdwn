 Jeb Bush fought amazingly (for a politician) to save
 Mrs. Schivao's life, so I suppose I should not be
 <em>too</em> upset that his administration is giving
 up the fight to block a 13 year old who is a ward of
 the state from having an abortion.  But I am.  Details are <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/d960000c8fbbc8f6.html">here</a>
 and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4510847.stm">here</a>.
 Governor Bush, in his press release, is absolutely correct, there
 is simply no good news at all related to this case.  Its not good
 news that she became pregnant, it is not good news that she is
 getting an abortion.</p>
