There exists an elementary school that has a "reading time" for its third-grade students, in which they may read a book of their choosing.  One child chose to read the Bible, and was told by the school that he may not.[^bible724]  Unfortunately, I cannot honestly express surprise that this series of events happened in the United States.  Fortunately, the school in question backed down after receiving a letter from the Thomas More Law Center reminding them that such activity has been repeatedly protected by the United States Supreme Court.
