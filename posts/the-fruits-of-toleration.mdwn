<p>A look at the reality we are supposed to tolerate:  <ul> <li>One out of every three children is having sex at the age of 10.<a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=15&art_id=vn20050710123619850C495299">[1]</a></li> <li>17 out of 100 will deliberately spread the virus if they know they are HIV-positive.[1]</li> <li>At 18, two out of every three children had had sex.[1]</li> <li>One in 10 said they believed sex with a virgin could cure HIV/Aids.[1]</li> <li>One in 10 had been raped in the past year.[1]</li> <li>Three out of every 100 pupils thought that girls liked sexually violent boys.[1]</li> <li>One out of every 10 thought that girls who got raped, asked for it.[1]</li> </ul>  Apparently two out of 10 know not to trust condoms, but that is small indeed in the face of so much evil.  The above describes a society, a reality, that cannot, must not, be tolerated.  It must be eradicated.</p>
