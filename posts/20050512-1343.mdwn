<p>Terence Jeffrey has uncovered some of the horrors that the
National Academy of Science has cooked up and called "ethics."[1]
They recommend creating human clones.  Since that is not palpable
to the majority of us (for now at least, a majority of us are not
that confused and insane), they then recommend killing those babies
when they reach 14 days old.  And then they re-assure us that they
do not want to be injecting human stem cells into animal embryos,
which could result in a human brain "trapped" in an animal body,
"for now," and expect we will be satisfied.</p>
