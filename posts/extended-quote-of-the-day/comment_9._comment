<p>From this point on, the argument runs in circles. It all turns around whether the size of the Universe and it's assumed age is enough or not to make a small probability such as our current Earth possible as it is in a random sequence of events. 
You believe it's not, from what I understand, because the probability is very, very small.
I believe it is because of what is currently believed about the age and size of the Universe. The age is not really known, but is extrapolated to be something between 10 to 20 <em>billion</em> years. That gives plenty of time for small deviations making it more or less likely for a planet to contain life as Earth has today. In a way, that I also believe in the possibility of other planets reaching Earth's stage at an earlier or later time with some thousand, even tens or hundreds of thousand years of deviation.
About the size, then, it's so big that nobody is able to give a good guess. The best arrived yet is to try to get a lower boundary from what's visible from Earth. This lower boundary alone is believed to be around <em>50 billion light years</em>, or 475,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers. In our galaxy alone, there are <em>100 billion stars</em> like our Sun. Put that against the number of <em>visible</em> galaxies and see what you get.</p>
