<p>I <em>have</em> examined the replies.  I find them lacking.  Many of them leave you wondering if the author of the reply actually read the book.</p>

<p>How is it misusing probability?  Am I misusing probability to say that, if I'm in a poker game and the other person gets 4 aces on 4 consecutive hands of 5 card stud, that something fishy is going on?  Not all uses of probability are as invalid as the Torah Code example you gave.</p>

<p>Which example is closer to the truth?  You do not know that yours is, because you do not really know the the size of the space that events have happened in, nor the number of different possibilities.</p>
