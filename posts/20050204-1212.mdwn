Anyone who follows gaim development is almost certainly never
going to find this.  But anyone who has found this, likely knows
how much time I spend thinking about gaim.  Currently we are in a
huge quandary over where to draw the line between being reasonably
featureful and offering users choices, and keeping the user
interface simple enough for the "average" user to comprehend.  "<a href="http://www.ofb.biz/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=351&mode=&order=0&thold=0">Edging
Toward the Ninety/Ten</a>" adds to this debate, being waged
in one for or another across the open source world.  It does
however make some mistakes: it assumes that every user wants
<em>the same 10% of options and features</em>.  If that were the
case, you wouldn't see migration costs moving from MacOS&#xae;;
to Windows&#xae;; or vice versa.  One would be easier to use,
and there would be a one way learning curve.  Really, good UI
means "doing what people expect," and then realizing that people
expect different things depending on their background.  Options
should be <em>just barely</em> available enough to compensate for
different backgrounds, or else you get the kind of UI that causes <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/navLinks/fog0000000247.html">Joel
On Software</a> to become very popular writing about software
development.
