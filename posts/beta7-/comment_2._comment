<p>I think 2.0b7 is the best release in a very long time! It's very stable too. It hasn't crashed once since I installed it some days ago on two of my computers. I love the new look too. The only negative thing I can think of is that I seem to get a few more "switchboard errors" after the last beta, but that might be completely unrelated.</p>

<p>Good work! I'll keep bugging you guys in Trac whenever I feel something is quirky or needs an improvement. ;-)</p>
