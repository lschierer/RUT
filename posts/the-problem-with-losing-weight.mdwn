is that I get hungry!  Still, according to the scale, I weighed only 207.5 pounds this morning,  that is a new low since I have been weighing myself.  Even though I do not really trust the scale at all for absolute weight, it should still be fairly accurate for relative weight.  That is, it told me that I weighted 220 something when I started weighing    myself, so I should be able to reliably state that I now weigh 13 pounds *less* than I started out (well, more than 13 pounds, I started weighing myself significantly after I started losing weight), even though I do not reliably know what my weight is now. 

Thirteen pounds might not sound like much, and in a very real sense it *is* not much, but it has come *without exercising.*  That is very important when you consider how much I dislike exercising.  

I wonder how far down I will drop. I am *not* starving myself, I am simply trying to do reasonable portion control for my normal eating, while allowing myself not to worry about food volume when Lauren and I go out.  I could do better if I tried to portion control then as well, but the basic idea here is to reduce the amount of will power necessary.  It is much easier to resist *buying* food than it is to resist *eating* it once purchased.
