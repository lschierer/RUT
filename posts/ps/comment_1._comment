<p>Hey! It ishard being on a different schedule.  I only noticed your comment on the feed over at LJ today because I almost never check the feeds there myself. Usually people comment on the journal it is syndicated from. And I just discovered I can't comment on the feed, because anonymous comments aren't enabled. And openid is considered "anonymous" by LiveJournal. <em>shakes fist</em></p>
