I think the reason you might get so many complaints on changes is that for a number of users, GAIM/Pidgin is one of the most important applications on the system. For me, Pidgin is more important than my phone - I use it many times a day to communicate with my servers, to talk with other people at work, and to chat with/arrange gatherings with friends. Changes to it make a big difference - if some changes are good for a majority but bad for a minority (or vice-versa), then complaints are inevitable.

FWIW, I disliked losing the protocol icons, and if they're back as an option, I'm happy to have them back. That said, the continued efforts to improve the interface, even knowing that I won't agree with all of them you have or will ever do, are welcome - rocking the boat exposes us to different way things can work and occasionally might change our minds. I may have occasionally complained, but in the end, pidgin is as important as vim to me - that's saying a lot.
