<h1>As one of the U.S. bishops working on the new translations writes: “Our current translation might seem more personal and friendly, but that’s the problem. The spirit referred to in the Latin is the spirit of Christ who comes to a priest when he is ordained, as St. Paul explained to Timothy. In other words, the people are saying in their response that Christ as head of the Church is the head of the liturgical assembly, no matter who the particular priest celebrant may be. That is a statement of faith, a statement distorted by transforming it into an exchange of personal greetings.”</h1>

<p>It's not a greeting.  And note, it's not "The Peace of the lord be with you,"  it's "The Lord be with you".  I don't believe the former is really in the missal, I may be mistaken however.  The original Latin form is "Dominus vobiscum" &lt;==> "The Lord is with you all"  Response: "And with your spirit"</p>
