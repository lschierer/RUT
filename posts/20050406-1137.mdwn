<p> "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-05-2005/92c60014335f4d0d.html">Marriage
in Maryland of Cousins Draws Fire</a>" amuses me as I once got
marked down on an paper in 8Th grade because, having read the book,
I realized that the two children in <em>The Secret Garden</em>
were cousins.  My teacher marked me down because I "must" be wrong
as first cousins marrying is illegal.  This article points how how
regional that thought process was.</p>
