<p>I don't believe that the stance on somebody wanting a feature, so they have to make it, is exactly right in this video/audio support. I doubt a lot of people who are requesting this (and it's being requested <em>everywhere</em> now. I'm pretty sure it's the most wanted thing in Pidgin among normal users) know how to even code. And at the same time I doubt a lot of coding types really feel free need for video/audio.</p>
