I see looking back that I never said anything other than the fact that there have been a lot of good movies out this summer, and that I enjoyed the Indiana Jones movie.  

We went to see the Incredible Hulk back when it was still in normal theaters.  I very much enjoyed it, even more so than I have the previous Hulk movie.  I look forward to sequels. <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font>

The newest Batman movie was certainly very different.  I do not at all regret going.  It was a little more disturbing than I like to see in a Batman movie though, and I hope they brighten things up for the next one.  True to the comic books though it no doubt is, I also dislike seeing Rachel die.  <font size="+2">&#x2639;</font>
