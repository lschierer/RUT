<p>Some time ago,[1] Germany legalized prostitution.  Apparently they
are not alone in doing so, Nevada and the Netherlands both also have
legalized prostitution.[2]  Sweden <em>did</em> but re-criminalized it,
because legalizing it did not solve the problems proponents had hoped
to solve (with legalization).  No surprise there.  Legalization also,
by and large, is not helping in Germany, and is still forcing some
women to choose between becoming a prostitute and being unemployed
&mdash; and ineligible for Germany's unemployment aid.  While I tend
to think that nationalized unemployment aid is beyond the scope of
just government, Germans are under such tax burdens that it would
not surprise me if there was no social infrastructure for aiding
people outside of the government assistance.  This puts unemployed
women in an unacceptable position and accentuates the immorality
of this tacit consent by the government on an immoral trade.</p>
