<p> According to <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/">feedvalidator.org</a>, it seems
that pretty much everything except some of the &amp;s in urls and
the &lt;p&gt; tags are acceptable.  This pleases me, as the hack
of including html when I should not was somewhat distressing.  The
sample is fairly representative, with some html entities, and some
of the formatting tags I commonly use.  So it seems I should look
for something to replace my use of &lt;p&gt;, but I doubt I actually
will.</p>
