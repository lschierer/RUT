"[States\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mull Taxing Drivers By Mile](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/eveningnews/main674120.shtml)" drew my attention yesterday,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though I did not post it. I didn't think it would come to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anything potentially worrisome quite so quickly. And really, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#isn't a necessarily bad idea on how to bring in taxes. It is less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#objectionable than the "hidden" tax on gasoline that we currently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pay. I dare say, most people, myself included, would be hard pressed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to state with any degree of certainty how much of a gasoline tax they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pay; this proposal would avoid that evil as you would necessarily\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have to pay it in some other form than as part of the built-in price\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of gasoline. That being said, if I were the one implementing it,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I would probably settle for a longer timetable in introducing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it and base it on a recording of your odometer every inspection.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That's already every one to two years, so we could just have you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pay your mileage tax at that time. It would be potentially very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unfair to people who spend a meaningful amount of time off-road,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I am unsure that the current system is substantially more far\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for this class of driver.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Healey\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proposes using GPS to protect abuse victims, gang crime\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#witnesses](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/02/16/healey_proposes_using_gps_to_protect_abuse_victims_gang_crime_witnesses/)" however brings immediately to the forefront the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#kind of action that I foresaw the global positioning system being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#used for when I first read the above article. The same risks are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of course built in to the OnStarâ„¢ system. We do not want\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to give Government this sort of control over our lives. We do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#want to trust government to sufficiently obscure the signals being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#used so that only the government can track us. Remember the lack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of privacy in "Minority Report"? The potienal for being tracked?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The difficulty in changing your "key" when it is a biometric?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#GPS systems are not quite so bad, you can ditch a device afterall.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But the same sort of risks are there. The system that lets a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#government track a criminal lets businesses and, as technology grows\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cheaper and more prevelent, eventually individuals track track\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#him also. And as people grow accusomed to tracking each other,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#eventually all of us. The California article is one way this will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#come to be, all of us being tracked to tax our milage. The RFID\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#concerns documented well by [EPIC](http://www.epic.org/)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and [EFF](http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/RFID/)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#represents another avenue for pervasive survalence to enter our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lives.
