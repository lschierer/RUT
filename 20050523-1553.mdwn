To no one surprise, the American Psychiatric Association, well\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#known (by me at least) as a source of liberal propaganda, has come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#out in support of homosexual "marriages."[1] Last week, Boundless\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#published an article on marriage, and the competing social views\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of it, that I thought hit home particularly well.[2] It proposes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that there are three views of marriage: 1)the traditional model,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#based on sexual complementarity and marriage as an institution\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#2)the choice model, looking at marriage essentially as an agreement\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#between sovereign selves, and 3)the postmodern, looking at marriage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as a codification of "the 'web of interdependence' that is created\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by this interaction with another person." Only in the second\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#two does the idea of a homosexual "marriage" make any sense, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only the first is the basis for a true marriage. Unfortunately,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even some Catholics have lost track of the fact that marriage is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more than just a social contract, and even more have forgotten or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rejected the concept of the sexes being complementary.
