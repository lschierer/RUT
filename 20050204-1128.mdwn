While it is interesting to see a theory get challenged, in this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#case the solar system formation theory that we all learned in grade\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#school or high school, there is something even more interesting in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Meteorite gives clues to Sun birth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4205227.stm)." What strikes me as more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interesting is that even when they are challenging a theory, they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are utterly certain that they know what's going on.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Also in science today, "[\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Life flourishes at crushing depth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4235979.stm)" documents the discovery of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#life at previously unexplored depths. This reminds me of some of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Dr. Thomas Gold's writings.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Sex and the single robot](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1403780,00.html?gusrc=rss)" is really disturbing. Robots with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#personalities and emotions? The mind boggles. This will decidedly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#blur the distinction between what is life and what is not.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Asimov's robot stories come to mind.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Next, "[Scientists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Find Missing Matter](http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,66487,00.html)" reports on the discovery of at least some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the "dark matter" that has been theorized for ages. Found it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by noticing that some intergalactic cloud was absorbing more than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it should. Neat.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Taking organ doning to the next logical level, "[Living donor\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#diabetes transplant](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4236873.stm)" reports on progress towards transplanting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*cells*, in this case insulin producing cells to treat Type\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#1 diabetes.
