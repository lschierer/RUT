Rich Lowry [criticizes"](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/richlowry/rl20050502.shtml)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pretty much every aspect of President Bush's unpassed energy,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I do not entirely agree. Sure, when the gas companies aren't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#too thrilled with the idea of drilling somewhere, it makes little\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sense for President Bush to be pushing it. Along the same lines,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#perhaps new refineries would not help the recent skyrocketing of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#gas prices. It is hard to say, I would tend to think that they are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#likely making a killing off of the higher prices, and are reluctant\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to have any reason to lower prices again. It could, however be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#true that upgrades make more sense than new refineries, so I will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#give Mr. Lowry the benefit of the doubt on that one also.

He then continues to lump all requests for federal funding to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#aid in development of new fuel technologies as likely dead ends.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#His logic? If they were not dead ends, they would not need funding.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Surely the flaw in that thinking is self evident. They want\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#federal funding *because it is available*. Not because\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they need it, the research will happen, is happening, regardless\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of how much the federal government funds it. Because much of it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*is* bearing fruit, over time. Hybrid and electric cars\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#used to be a joke. They were a toy for the rich tree-hugger,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#never expected to take off. They were horrid, they did not do as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#well as combustion engines for city driving, they did not have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the battery life for highway driving, and they did not have the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#torque to handle any serious incline. A few years later, they have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worked out many of the bugs in the design, dropped (for now only\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I expect) the idea of a pure electric car, dropped the (again,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#perhaps only for now) the ineffective and ugly solar panels, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#produced a hybrid car that is not only popular, but (relatively)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#affordable, and quite usable. This is something that was funded\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by the government. Did it need to be? Absolutely not. Should it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have been? No, it really should not have been federally funded.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But it was, because the funds were available for the asking, not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because the research was a dead end.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Do people ask for federal funding for dead end research? I am\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quite sure they do. Quite a bit of corporate research is "lost\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#effort" as well. And perhaps the bureaucratic oversight instead of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cost-driven oversight means that a greater percentage of federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#research goes down the drain. But the correct lesson to learn from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is not that all requests for federal research are for bogus\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ideas, but that federal subsidies are simply not an effective way\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at stimulating effective research. The one exception rather proves\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the rule. The National Institutes of Health churns out quite a bit.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Even though it likely does not compare to John Hopkins, or some of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the other research schools, it does good work. It does so however,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because the scientists by and large cannot stay. They are all on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#temporary grants, having to justify their existence in some cases,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and unrenewable grants in other cases. So every one of them\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has a motive to self-police so that they can get a job at a real\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#institution three to five years down the line.
