In response to #1:

Matthew 27:

51
And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.  The earth quaked, rocks were split,
52
tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
53
And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
