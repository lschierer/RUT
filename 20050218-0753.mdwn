So, according to "[Oldest\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fossil 'rabbit' unearthed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4274129.stm)," finding a fossil rabbit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#***20 million years earlier*** than any\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#previous rabbit "adds weight to the idea that rabbit-like creatures\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#first evolved no earlier than 65 million years ago." I find\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this fascinating. If that confirms the theory, what would manage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to call the theory into question (without actually constituting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a contradiction of the theory)? Would anything? This is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#**prime** example of why I do not like evolution.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If something doesn't happen, that proves it wasn't designed.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If something does, it proves it did evolve. <sarcasm\>This\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sounds so incredibly scientific to you as well I am sure.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#</sarcasm\>
