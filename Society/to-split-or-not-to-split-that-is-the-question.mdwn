It appears the Anglican church is still struggling with the decision of the
American and Canadian branch(es) to have an openly gay bishop and to bless
homosexual unions.[^1]  It is interesting that even the "traditionalists" are
speaking of this in terms of "practice and discipline" when it really comes down
to a matter of doctrine.   But the Anglican church *would* have trouble
with that one, after all, they split over a matter of doctrine, the primacy of
the Pope.  ;-)
