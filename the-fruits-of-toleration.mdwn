#+TITLE: The fruits of toleration

A look at the reality we are supposed to tolerate:

-   One out of every three children is having sex at the age of 10.[[1]](http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=15&art_id=vn20050710123619850C495299)
-   17 out of 100 will deliberately spread the virus if they know they are HIV-positive.[1]
-   At 18, two out of every three children had had sex.[1]
-   One in 10 said they believed sex with a virgin could cure HIV/Aids.[1]
-   One in 10 had been raped in the past year.[1]
-   Three out of every 100 pupils thought that girls liked sexually violent boys.[1]
-   One out of every 10 thought that girls who got raped, asked for it.[1]

Apparently two out of 10 know not to trust condoms, but that is small indeed in the face of so much evil. The above describes a society, a reality, that cannot, must not, be tolerated. It must be eradicated.
