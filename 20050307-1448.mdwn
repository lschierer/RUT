Kathleen Parker is apparently a rather exceptional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#woman. She thinks that fathers are not useless,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that men have a point, a value, an reason for being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#beyond mere procreation. She makes this evident in "[Undoing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the damage of male-bashing, one daughter at a time](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/kathleenparker/kp20050302.shtml)," an article\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that warms my heart to read. What is more amazing is that a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#college professor, a female college professor, actually agrees\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with this heretical idea, and is teaching a class based on it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And isn't being fired. There are some interesting statistics here,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and I'm somewhat tempted to get the book it mentions. It would be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yet another on my unending to-read list.
