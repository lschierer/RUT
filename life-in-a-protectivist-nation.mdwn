Maine is now being sued to see if you can be arrested for drinking on private property even if you are not causing a public disturbance.[[1]](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/07-08-2005/64500013a5ccda3f.html) I expect at issue here is as much the police's version of events versus the Mr. Laverriere's though, so nothing much may happen here. It is interesting and somewhat alarming to note though how far we have gone from the ideals of freedom. Mr. Laverriere is right in suing here, this action flies in the face of what one would expect to see in a free country.
