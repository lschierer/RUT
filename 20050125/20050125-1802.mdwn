<a href="http://www.lsureveille.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/01/25/41f5eb5a8887d">This
story from the LSU Reveille</a> also mentioned <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001333.htm">here
in Michelle Malkin's web log</a> brings up a very good
question.  Why is it only a hate crime if it is committed
against some hip minority?  Why is it not a hate crime
to vandalize the crosses used in this Christian protest?
Why are Christians not eligible for toleration by those
who disagree with us?
