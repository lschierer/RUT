Mr. George Monbiot publishes an article^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^ in rival paper "The Guardian," addressing some of Mr. Christopher Monckton's claims.^[\\[2\\]][ref3]^ His refutation is much less referenced. He also falls into the fallacy of assuming that anything that comes from a peer reviewed journal is necessarily more authoritative than anything that does not. Considering some of the utter garbage claiming to refute Intelligent Design that I have seen coming from peer reviewed journals, my own perspective is to take both the news paper article and the journal article at face value, and give neither greater credence.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, it may be that Mr. Monckton has overstated his claims and/or been misleading himself. I think the refutation insufficient, but then I am hardly objective.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
