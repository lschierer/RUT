Scientists have found that while canaries are excellent imitators\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#while very young, once they hit puberty, they drop any "false"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#songs they have learned and sing according to ridged rules.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They are as yet unsure of the birds sound the same to each other,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is, if females will mate with the males who learned other\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#songs while young, as readily, more readily, or less readily than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"normal" canaries. They are correct, that this is fascinating.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Why would canaries have this ability to learn other songs while\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#young, only to drop it later? Why would they have the ability to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learn at all when they do not seem to need the example to learn the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"correct" songs?
