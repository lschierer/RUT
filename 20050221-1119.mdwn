"[Brain-controlled\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#'robo-arm' hope](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4275245.stm)" talks about controlling a robot\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#arm from probes embedded in a monkey's brain. "[Athlete\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cheats seek genetic boost](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3493839.stm)" has a really wrongheaded focus.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Athletes using drugs to build their bodies is nothing new.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Being able to use gene therapy to modify the body is much more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#news worthy.
