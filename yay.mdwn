After first trying to edit the "default" theme, and then the "classic" theme, I have things looking more or less as they should. The menu on the right is higher than I would like, but it will do for now. I am pleased that I was able to get the colors more or less right fairly easily, even though I am not sure that I have everything perfect yet. Tooltips have not been looked at, and I expect some of the pages that *I* do not, or have not, look[ed] at might be "wrong." Much progress has been made, and I am pleased. â˜º\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
