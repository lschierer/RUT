So the whale-dolphin mix over in Hawaii made Yahoo news today.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I've known about it for some time, and have used it as an example\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of how messed up our science is today. You realize there aren't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#any research papers on this beast? And it has given birth!\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#A cross bread like this should be sterile, if the parents were\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in fact different species. Now the Yahoo News story says they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are in the same family, I remember reading that you had to go\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up another level before they were grouped together, but still,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these are **not** the same *genus* much less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#same species. Or at least so we have thought. I wounder, which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will give, the definition of species, the classification of each,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or will it continue to be ignored?

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
This is ***huge*** news because there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#**is** a scientific definition of species, and it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does not allow for this event. Two things **must**\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be in the same species if when they mate they produce fertile\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#offspring. Further, this article says something I had *not*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#heard before: there are rumors that this happens in the wild also.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is not just a freak of close confinement. But even if it were,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do you think its all that common that a big dog, say a great dane,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as I am not all that familiar with dogs, and a small one, say a toy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#poodle, would mate? Yet we don't worry about them being lumped in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the same species. We understand that you simply cannot separate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them, as they are clearly in the same species with dogs that are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#clearly in the same species…you get the idea. You simply\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cannot split them. This does the same thing for that family, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#challenges the idea that that family has more than one species in it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If this sort of thing were to happen to other families, you'd see\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a sharp reduction in the species counts. On one hand this would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in fact make Darwin's claims easier; but not meaningfully so.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The big challenge to Darwin is its ability to create life,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and its ability to grow it to multi-cellular organisms at all.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The biochemical is the unanswerable challenge. On the other hand,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this reduces the complexity of Noah's task as well. And that is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a welcome development. ☺
