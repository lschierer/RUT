The CS Monitor has an article today talking about the state\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of "second wives" in France.[1] Apparently France only very\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#recently outlawed polygamy, and a number of African men have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#come to France bringing multiple "wives" and the children of both\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"wives." The article highlights the problems that come from lack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of enforcement since the 1993 outlawing, and the unwillingness of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the government to deal with those polygamous families it allowed in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before outlawing polygamy. While the outlawing of polygamy is both\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rational and moral, it is immoral to treat these women as somehow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#neither married nor single and thus allow them to fall through the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cracks. Naturally, they cannot be married as a marriage is between\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one man and one woman, so they must be single with children, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#should be legally so treated. Worse, I am sure this sort of thing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will be used by liberals world-wide to try to pressure France to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#repeal the law. This would be an unmitigated disaster, with the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#marriage under attack from so many other angles as well.
