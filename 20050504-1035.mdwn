Legal news run down:

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Texas\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Lawmakers OK Cheerleading Ban](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050504/D89S4EJO0.html)" Of note: one, the common sense\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#approach of "any married adult knows it when they see it," and two,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if you waited to do good things until the "big" issues were all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#addressed, you would make far less net progress.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Foreign\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court Gun Conviction Doesn't Bar U.S. Ownership, Supreme Court\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Says](http://news.findlaw.com/andrews/pl/gun/20050503/20050503small.html)" "any court" only refers to US courts. This is apparently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#common sense, because "Congress generally legislates with domestic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#concerns in mind." But it is okay to look at other countries when\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we dislike what a domestic view would lead to.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Democrats\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Sue Over Indiana Voter ID Law](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/d93a000efc020a9d.html)" Its too much to prove you aren't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#dead, and are who you say you are. Now its debatable that we should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have to ID for the polls at all perhaps, but as long as you have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to give your name and address, giving a photo with that name is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not a legitimate cause for concern.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Attorney\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Who Leaked Secret FBI Tape to Reporter Charged With Contempt,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Perjury](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115111117689)" this guy obviously does not have the right friends,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if he knew the Clintons, then he would not be charged, just like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that State department official was not charged.
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
"[Lawyers\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Seek Pass From Privacy Law](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115111120593)" lawyers do not want to follow a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#law that is just fine for the rest of us apparently. So much for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"equal protection."
