The quote[\^20081114-3] actually says\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# \* science != consensus \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# \* politics == consensus \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# \* science == âˆƒ X such that ((X == investigator) && (X == "correct"); where ("correct" == "results are verifiable in reference to the real world"))\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The problem is that skepticism does \*not\* reign throughout much of science. Rather, dogmatism reigns. Anyone who dissents is silenced. If the environment we have today existed, Einstein would not have been able to publish, he upset too many careers. But back then the science journals were not as tightly controlled as they are now, and it was more possible then for a radical idea to get published.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is then asked, "what does it mean to say \*in reference to the real world\*."[\^20081114-4] A valid question. What is meant here is that results have to bear out, taking relativity for an example again, we can see that the data fits better than Newtonian physics. However, Global Warming doesn't account for a great deal of the data out there. Relativity fits the real world. Global warming is questionable at best. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^20081114-3]: Mr. Luke Schierer. "Quote of the Day" Random Unfinished Thoughts. 2008-11-14
