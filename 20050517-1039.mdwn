It appears that the ecumenical efforts over the years are starting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to make progress. It has been announced today that an agreement\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the doctrines surrounding Mary has been reached and is being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#forwarded to the Vatican and the Anglican council.[1] Supposedly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#something has happened that now Anglicans can admit that the Church's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#teaching is compatible with Scripture (of course it is), and can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be accepted by them. It remains to be seen if it *will*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be accepted. From the fact that it needs to be forwarded to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Vatican, I take it that it also needs to be determined that those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#involved accurately preserved the Church's teaching. This is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#necessary because, despite the claims of many in the protestant\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#world, and despite the desires of those who would change the Church,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who would "modernize" it, the Church does not invent doctrine, does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not change it, it only clarifies it to defend it from heresies that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#once did not exist, and brings it to a wording that will accurately\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#convey the age old truth in language people today can understand.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is wonderful news, and I hope that it can be accepted by the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Church (which will mean it is not a change, but simply a better\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#understanding on the part of the Anglicans (you can see why I am not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and will not likely ever be part of any ecumenical dialog here)),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and is accepted by the Anglicans. I think it will mean an easier\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#path home for those lost in the Anglican heresy/schism. I hope it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will mean that more will find their way home than do currently.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#For while the numbers finding their way home may have increased in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the time since the church in England went heretic, not all are home,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and so the numbers are necessarily too few.
