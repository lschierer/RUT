I no longer read as much as I once did. I finish perhaps little\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more books each year than I once read in a month. This is somewhat\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#depressing, but also reflects a life in which I am out more. I did\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not have a computer when I read that much, I rarely went out with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#friends (really, did not at all). Still, George Weigel reminds me\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how much there is still to read, and gives a nice set of names and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a few titles as a starting place.[1]
