Was the *Lemon* test from the *Lemon v. Kurtzman*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#case in 1971 a decision of the Warren court? "Waiting on the Ten\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Commandments: High Court Shift or Attorney Strategy?"[1] provides\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more details on the 10 Commandments case than I had previously heard.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It also talks about some speculation that the *Lemon* test will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be overturned. The speculation really is guesswork, so not too note\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worthy, but it did make me stop and thing, hence the question.
