<p>Was the <i>Lemon</i> test from the <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman</i>
case in 1971 a decision of the Warren court?  "Waiting on the Ten
Commandments: High Court Shift or Attorney Strategy?"[1] provides
more details on the 10 Commandments case than I had previously heard.
It also talks about some speculation that the <i>Lemon</i> test will
be overturned.  The speculation really is guesswork, so not too note
worthy, but it did make me stop and thing, hence the question.</p>
