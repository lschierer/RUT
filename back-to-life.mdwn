I do not think I would call them "zombie" dogs, but draining a dog of blood and then 3 hours later bringing it back to life is certainly freaky.[[1]](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html) I shudder to think of this being used on humans. What does this mean for the soul? I really have no clue, a question to ask Fr. Pollard.
