A few days later an owl arrived for Ginny with the expected reply from her grandmum.  Ginny took it upstairs to her room to read with Harry.  
> Dear Ginny and Harry,
> I applaud your generosity in helping your brother achieve his educational goals.  Since your goals are noble, I will support you in reassuring Charles that the money you gave him is honestly come by. You may, when you write him, state that I know where the money came from, and that I can confirm that it is yours to give in this manner, and further that he may accept it without fear or reservation.  
> 
> You need to consider how and when you will allow your family into this part of your life.  You are just starting to experience the problems that keeping this secret will continue to cause.  I cannot guarantee, even with my support, that Charles will accept an evasive answer.  He may continue to press you to come clean.  
> 
> Love,
> 
> Grandmum Prewett

While this response helped Ginny to approach her letter to Charlie without the panic she had experienced on first seeing his questions, it left plenty of room for worry.  Harry comforted her as best he could.  Part of him wanted to tell her parents, while another part continued to feel that they should wait until the family was all together again.  Ginny's letter to Charlie leaned heavily on her grandmum's support, while otherwise entirely dodging the question.  Errol took so long on each delivery, that it was not until after Charlie got back from his trip that they could expect a reply.
