A few days later an owl arrived for Ginny with the expected reply from her grandmum.  Ginny took it upstairs to her room to read with Harry.  
_Dear Ginny and Harry,
I applaud your generousity in helping your brother achieve his educational goals.  Since your goals are noble, I will support you in reasssuring Charles that the money you gave him is honestly come by. You may, when you write him, state that I know where the money came from, and that I can confirm that it isyours to give in this manner, and further that he may accept it without fear or reservation.  

You need to consider how and when you will allow your family into this part of your life.  You are just starting to experience the problems that keeping this secret will continue to cause.  I cannot guarrantee, even with my support, that Charles will accept an evasive answer.  He may continue to press you to come clean.  

Love,

Grandmum Prewett_
While this responce helped Ginny to approach her letter to Charlie without the panic she had experienced on first seeing his questions, it left plenty of room for worry.  Harry comforted her as best he could.  Part of him wanted to tell her parents, while another part continued to feel that they should wait until the family was all together again.
