Dumbledore entered the staff room prepared for the worst.  The staff was
not going to react well to the news that Harry Potter was missing, but he
needed their help. He knew that at the very least, the people in this room
could be trusted to keep the news secret.

A few days later an owl arrived for Ginny with the expected reply from
her grandmum.  Ginny took it upstairs to her room to read with Harry. 

> Dear Ginny and Harry,
> 
> I applaud your generosity in helping your brother
achieve his educational goals.  Since your goals are noble, I will support
you in reassuring Charles that the money you gave him is honestly come
by. You may, when you write him, state that I know where the money came
from, that I can confirm that it is yours to give in this manner,
and further that he may accept it without fear or reservation.
> 
> You need to consider how and when you will allow your family into this
part of your life. You are just starting to experience the problems
that keeping this secret will continue to cause. I cannot guarantee,
even with my support, that Charles will accept an evasive answer. He may
continue to press you to come clean.
> 
> Love,
> 
> Grandmum Prewett

While this response helped Ginny to approach her letter to Charlie
without the panic she had experienced on first seeing his questions, it
left plenty of room for worry.  Harry comforted her as best he could.
Part of him wanted to tell her parents, while another part continued
to feel that they should wait until the family was all together again.
Ginny's letter to Charlie leaned heavily on her grandmum's support,
while otherwise entirely dodging the question.  Errol took so long on
each delivery, that they could not expect a reply until after Charlie got back from his
trip.
