#### Dumbledore

Musings of Apathy, in writing the original version of this story, envisions Dumbledore as (my words) misguided, and perhaps ruthless, but not evil.[^20180702-2]  As I work with this story, he might become a little darker than I think Musings of Apathy originally intended.  One of the things that really struck me as I started to really think about the Harry Potter books (as opposed to just enjoying them as stories), is just how valid some of the common fanfiction criticisms of Dumbledore are.  In no particular order:

* Harry's scar as a horocrux:
  * [Saving the Saviour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11833745/14/Saving-the-Saviour) talks about how Dumbledore didn't have Harry examined at all by a Healer after that fateful Halloween night.  Could the soul fragment Riddle left have been detected?  Could something have been done about it? 
  * I really like the theory from [The Thory Rose 2](http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129781&textsize=1&chapter=13): 
    > "But if you know about the Horcruxes, then you will know that they can only be destroyed by the most destructive of forces. There is no way Harry could survive that," the old wizard pointed out.  
    >  
	> "What’s the matter? Is your hearing going? As I just said; that would be the case if Harry was a proper Horcrux, but he isn’t! His body was never prepared in the correct manner that Horcrux receptacles are required to be and he wasn’t subjected to a Binding Ritual, either. Voldemort’s sliver of soul isn’t properly integrated with Harry’s," Ginny yelled in anger.   
  * More or less a follow up to the previous point, but further consider.  Dumbledore states that he did not know that Harry would survive.  Dumbledore _hoped_ that Harry would.  Dumbledore, by his own admission, knows that Harry will be willing to sacrifice himself.  The reason implied is that Dumbledore is well aware of Harry's heroic virtue.  But when you consider how much Dumbledore hid from Harry, how calculated the final revelation is, I think there is more to it.  Dumbledore is not leaving anything to chance - I agree with fanfiction authors who think that Dumbledore has, in the choices he has made regarding Harry's upbringing, purposefully worked to shape Harry into someone who will make that choice.  This does not negate Harry's virtue; Dumbledore is building on Harry's nature, not creating it out of whole cloth.  Honestly, if Dumbledore were as calculating about subjecting Harry to abuse as some authors would have him, then he took an incredibly reckless chance.  Dumbledore, knows how similar Harry's situation is to Riddle's childhood.  I think that this plan is something that Dumbledore came to over time, not something he intended from the beginning.  
* Dumbledore does not seem to know about the horocruxes until he is presented with the diary.  He knew Riddle had survived the Halloween encounter with Harry, but apparently did nothing to investigate this.
* Dumbledore placed Mrs. Figg to watch Harry.  She knows she has to be unpleasant to him to retain access to him and thus fulfill her mission.  Surely this was reported to Dumbledore over the years.  He presumably did not believe her, possibly because she is a squib, and he has some of the pure-blood's unconscious prejudices against them.  Alternately, while he does believe her, he is risks both Harry turning evil and Harry's health, because he views the odds that Harry will be killed by a Death Eater and/or a returned Riddle that probable.  There _must_ have been some middle ground.  Between Dumbledore's civil authority on the Wizengamot, and his experience with and control over magic, he could have dome _something_ to intervene in Harry's treatment.

#### The Wards around Privet Drive

Musings of Apathy, in writing the original version of this story, speculates that the wards either can and have collapsed without the monitors showing it, or that they never worked.[^20180702-3]  I think, if we are going to preserve Dumbledore, I have to modify this theory.  I suspect that the wards did establish, and did work.  Harry, as of Chapter 9, is still afraid of being sent back to Privet Drive.  He is still thinking of the Burrow as _Ginny's home_ and not yet as _his home_, and has only been gone for a couple of months, less than he will later be gone as part of each school year.  Thus the wards would remain standing.  If I succeed in going anywhere with this attempt the wards will fail when Harry and Ginny come clean to her parents, and Harry starts to feel secure in his new life.  At that point, his view of home will shift, and, because he (at that point) no longer views Privet Drive as home, the wards will suddenly fail.
