[[!meta title="HP Stories with Responsible Adults"]]

So often children's literature is possible because the adults in those stories
are incompetent.  Sometimes they are well-meaning, sometimes they are not,
sometimes they are *trying* and failing, other times they are effectively
negligent.  Sometimes they are simply effectively absent.  Irregardless, the
story is only possible because children are doing things that adults should
have taken care of.  The Harry Potter series is no exception, though it differs
from many in that it features adults in *all* of these categories.  

This is a collection of fan fiction stories that are note-worthy primarily
because they showcase some aspect of adults being â€¦ adults.

    * Comments: This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
      [[Dursleys|Notes/Dursleys]] looking back and explaining to a younger
      relative how it is that he, and the rest of the neighbourhood, came to
      overlook [[Harry|Notes/Harry]]'s living situation.  It then enters the
      Responsible Adult alternate universe by positing that people might have
      realised that Petunia was lying about [[Harry|Notes/Harry]]'s secondary
      schooling and treated him like a missing child.  This story is noteworthy
      because prior to reading this, despite the fact that I am, or ought to be
      (based on my own rants on the topic), fully aware of just how caste based
      English society can be, I had overlooked just how effective Petunia's lies
      would have been to that audience.

    * Comments: In this story a [[basilisk|Notes/animals/basilisk]] is treated
      as a weapon of mass destruction.  There are mandatory procedures in place
      that are actually followed.
