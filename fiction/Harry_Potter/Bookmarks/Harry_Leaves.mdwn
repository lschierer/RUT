    * Comments: This story leaves the question of [[Horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]]
      in an ambiguous state.  It is surprisingly complete picture of
      [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] for such a short one-shot, but at the expense of any
      real epilogue to give a sense of closure.  There are a number of things I
      like in this that are mentioned but not fully explored.  
      * [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] realises that many of his problems are self
        caused in one sense, but the root cause is the effectively random
        oscillation between expecting him to handle things as an adult (which he
        isn't yet) and totally consign responsibilities over *to* the adults
        (despite the fact that he can see they are failing at handling things).
        I experienced this oscillation myself growing up, and it *does* make
        responding correctly very difficult.  As a parent now, I also see the
        other side, how difficult it is to *not* do this to children.
      * [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] realises, looking back,  that part of the
        separation from his friends was his own fault.  We do not however, see
        more than hints of the *outcome* of this realisation.  
      * This story lets [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] be an unusually strong wizard
        (most people cannot do nearly the wandless magic he can) without being
        overpowered (despite his prowess, without a wand he is still too weak to
        matter in a straight up magical fight).  In other words, we can see him
        as the one marked by the "Dark Lord" as "his equal."  I've argued that
        you cannot really do that even in the actual canonical books.
