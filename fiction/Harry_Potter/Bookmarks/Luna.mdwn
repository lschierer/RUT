[[!meta title="HP Stories with Luna as a Primary Character"]]

In general I feel that while Luna and Harry will almost always be friends, that
unless you change one or the other significantly, they will never be more than
that.  Still, there are some stories where she is the main character that are
worth remembering.

    * Comments: This one has no particular pairing, and avoids names in a few
      places that is both odd and slightly annoying.  I have never read any of
      [[!wikipedia H. P. Lovecraft]]'s works, as I do not in general like
      horror, but I *am* vaguely familiar with his body of work.  Here Luna is
      descended from the [Marsh Family][MFLC], from [[!wikipedia H. P.
      Lovecraft]]'s stories.  When pushed too far one day, that heritage comes
      outâ€¦
