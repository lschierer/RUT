It is relatively rare to find this as a primary pairing, most often these
stories feature some type of revenge on [[Draco|Notes/Families/Malfoy/Draco]]
instead of a positive relationship between these two as a primary pairing.  I am
not interested in violating marriage vows as a form of revenge, momentary
pleasure, or drunkenness.  

These stories will focus on a version of [[Astoria|Notes/Families]] that build
off of the *lack* of detail we have about her character.  Mrs. Rowling's
descriptions about the decision process that, in the cannon material, lead to
her marriage is incredibly vague and in some ways even suggestive.  These
stories take that vague suggestion and run with it.

    * Comments: When [[Ron|Notes/Ron]] and [[Hermione|Notes/Hermione]] both
      abandon [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] after he is selected by the Goblet of Fire,
      [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] is alone.  When [[Astoria|Notes/Families]]
      unexpectedly reaches out to him, there is nothing left to hold him back.
