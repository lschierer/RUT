  Harry spends a few days as a student in his parents' seventh year just after
  wining the canonical battle.  He reveals very little while he is back there,
  but is responsible for encouraging [[Lily|Notes/adults/Lily]] to reevaluate
  her relationships, and [[Dumbledore|Notes/adults/Dumbledore]] to trust the
  prophesy.
