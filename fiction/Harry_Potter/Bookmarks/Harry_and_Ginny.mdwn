While [[Ginny|Notes/Ginny]] has flaws, I remain partial to this pairing.
Unfortunately fan fiction rarely does it justice.  

=_[Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2456938)_=
    * Author: Ophiuchus
    * Published: 2005-06-27. Updated: 2005-08-07. 
    * Comments: This story ignores the concept of [[Horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]],
      and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room
      in the Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
      trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like Harry as a
      phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like
      is the trunks.

=_[Hope for the Best, Plan for the Worst](https://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130020)_=
    * Author: Just Horsing Around
    * Published: 2015-10-09. Updated: 2015-10-19.
    * Comments: This story pre-dates [[Ginny|Notes/Ginny]]'s confidence around
      [[Harry|Notes/Harry]] to his time in [[Grimmauld
      Place|Notes/Grimmauld_Place]] rather than the slower and mostly off
      "screen" build-up that we see in the canonical story line.  Here Ginny
      convinces and helps Harry to prepare for his trial rather than rely on
      [[Dumbledore|Notes/Dumbledore]].  This turns out to be for the best, as
      [[Lucius|Notes/Families/Malfoy]] is rather more openly active in this
      version.  It is unfortunate that the author did not develop this concept
      further.

=_[Walk Away Without Noticing](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14040641/5/Walk-Away-Without-Noticing)_=
    * Author: Hippothestrowl 
    * Published: 2022-02-17. Updated: 2022-03-17.
    * Comments: This is one of the stories where Harry sends his memories back
      in time.  Unlike most, this Harry decides that he is best off using his
      memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.
