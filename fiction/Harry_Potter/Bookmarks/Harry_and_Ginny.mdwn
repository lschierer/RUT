While [[Ginny|Notes/Ginny]] has flaws, I remain partial to this pairing.
Unfortunately fan fiction rarely does it justice.

    * Comments: This story ignores the concept of [[Horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]],
      and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room
      in the Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
      trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like Harry as a
      phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like
      is the trunks.
