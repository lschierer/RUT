James really should not have existed at all.  He was born, per cannon, after his
parents were already old.  I am taking that fairly literally, and saying that
since magic interfered with their fertility, it interfered with his magical
inheritance as well. 

Harry Potter: 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,

Harry is, as you can see, slightly above an average of his parents except in a
couple of key categories where he straight up inherited the more powerful
ability.  As the child of two exceptionally powerful parents, even a partial
inheritance can still result in someone really really powerful. 

If you compare Harry to [[Riddle]], you will see that really Harry is a much
more balanced wizard, he has neither the highs nor the lows that Riddle has
(though neither is an especially strong Cherubim).  The one place that Harry
shines that Riddle does not is the Principalities - population effects.  This is
probably counter-intuitive.  Riddle works by intimidation, and while you *can*
intimidate populations, that is not actually what he does.  Instead he creates
atrocities, and allows his *actions* to act on the populace.  Remember that the
population effects from the Principalities are tied to locations, thus Harry is
unconsciously enhancing his environment with magics that affect the people
around him.  However, he will not find out that is happening until he has
travelled far enough to see what it looks like when people are *not* affected by
this magic.
