James really should not have existed at all.  He was born, per cannon, after his
parents were already old.  I am taking that fairly literally, and saying that
since magic interfered with their fertility, it interfered with his magical
inheritance as well. 

Harry Potter: 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,

Harry is, as you can see, slightly above an average of his parents except in a
couple of key categories where he straight up inherited the more powerful
ability.  As the child of two exceptionally powerful parents, even a partial
inheritance can still result in someone really really powerful.
