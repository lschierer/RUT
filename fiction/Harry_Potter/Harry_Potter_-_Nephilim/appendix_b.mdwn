Per the inheritance rules, you can follow a different rule for inheritance in
each column.  As an author this maximises my flexibility in one sense.  As a
world builder, it comes closer to how real inheritance works.  As a
documentation producer, it is nightmarish, because it makes understanding where
each character came from really complicated. Note, while I find it useful to
chart this out, **there is no in-world test that would reveal these numbers.**

Weasley   |Molly[^note19]  |4       |8       |2      |8        |8      |8     |8             |8         |8     |6.88

[^note19]: Molly was born with a higher score for Thrones.  Her own behaviour cost
    her ability. I suspect that Molly learned this from her own mother, and thus
    that while her score *was* higher at birth, it was not *much* higher,
    because she inherited a disability due to her (maternal) ancestor's
    misbehaviour along the same lines (love potions).  If not for that abnormally
    low score, her average would be one of the highest in the family. 

[^note18]: Ginny's brothers fear her temper for good reason.  Ginny seventh
    child, and the first girl in generations.  There is an implication that the
    Weasley family may have been cursed as part of a plot to isolate them by
    preventing them from making alliances by marriage.  If so, it stands to
    reason that as the curse wears away, the child that breaks the curse might
    absorb some of the residual energy and become correspondingly more powerful. 

[^note17]: Percy studied so hard because he, unlike Ron, is determined *not* to
    under perform.  The characters do *not* know about these power levels, so
    Percy does not know that he simply *isn't* as capable as his older brothers.

[^note16]: If you look, Bill has pretty much the ceiling score of his brothers
    in most categories, except virtues.  He needs someone else to brew potions
    for him 9 times out of 10 (hence Fleur is the healer in the family).  Bill
    is not taking advantage of any real 1%s, he is simply getting nearly the
    best of two powerful parents.

[^note15]: Reading the magic in magical creatures is key to Charlie's work.  He
    is fortunate that he does not need to transfigure much, and reasonably
    (though not stellar) scores in locality magic means that he can help with
    the protections at the reserve. 

[^note13]: I think Fred is slightly more perceptive than Ron.  Fred and George
    understand how magic works, though they do not realise they do so.  Fred is
    able to figure out potions but it takes a fair amount of trial and error to
    get the application of his magic right as he creates them for the first
    time. He does not have Ron's gift for locality based effects. 

[^note14]: George is average at reading people (for a nephil).  Slightly better
    at transmutation, he is not quite as good at potions (as compared to Fred).

[^note12]: Ron is an under-performer, he had the *ability* to do better than he
    did in the cannon text (based on these non-canonical power levels).
    That being said, Ron *is* under-powered as compared to his brothers.  If he
    knew that, his inferiority complex would be even worse than it is. 
    Interestingly, even though I was not trying, he and Hermione came out with
    identical averages.  Of particular note with Ron, I do not see him as
    particularly perceptive about people (low Seraphim).  I think his parents
    might well both have had higher scores in the Thrones, but we know that
    Molly dabbled in love potions.  This would be a type of magic that easily
    has detrimental effects.  When, in the canon universe, Ron, Harry and
    Hermione are on the run in book seven, Ron learns the spells to hide their
    campsite easily because that is a type of magic that does in fact come
    naturally to him. 

[^note11]: Hermione has very classic scores for the child of two squibs in the
    Seraphim, Thrones, and Principalities categories.  Her scores in the
    Cherubim, Archangels, and Angels categories suggest her parents may not in
    fact *be* squibs however.  With these scores, my guess is that they are
    themselves the children of squibs, but did not get the required scores to
    get noticed by the magical world.  The key thing about Hermione though is
    the Dominions, Virtues, and Powers categories.  These three scores all
    suggest that Hermione benefited from that 1% base rate of something bizarre
    happening.  

[^note10]: The canonical books talk about Dumbledore as the most powerful
    wizard known, the only one Riddle fears, and yet Dumbledore cannot defeat
    Riddle.  Why is this?  Here I provide a possible explanation that is not
    simply lack of will to do so.  The devil is in the details.  Riddle is
    exceptionally strong in both offensive and defensive magic (Archangels and
    Angels), Dumbledore is only above average offensively, but is superlative in
    transmutation, and the manipulation of physics and chemistry, he is also
    hard to beat at binding the will and augmenting nature.
    Unfortunately, Riddle actually equals or exceeds Dumbledore in the wand arts
    *except* in transmutation and temporary augmentation (Virtues).  Neither of
    these makes for an easy combat victory, and Riddle's strong offensive magic
    means that it essentially becomes a stand-off between the two.  Dumbledore's
    great intelligence lets him use transmutation and out-of-the-box thinking to
    make up for a lack of directly offensive capability.  
    
[^note1]: We have no canonical background information on Euphemia except for the
    fact that she was either a pure-blood or a half-blood.  Thus, I have moulded
    her to fit what I envision James to be.  She is an incredibly eclectic mix
    of highs and lows, in terms of ability.  

[^note2]: Fleamont was an incredible duellist and a good potioneer. 

[^note3]: James really should not have existed at all.  He was born, per cannon,
    after his parents were already old. In some places he he inherited the average of
    both parents, in others he inherited the sum total of both parents, and in a
    few places he has the stronger power.  

[^note4]: Harry is, as you can see, slightly above an average of his parents
    except in a couple of key categories where he straight up inherited the more
    powerful ability.  As the child of two exceptionally powerful parents, even a
    partial inheritance can still result in someone really really powerful.
    These represent Harry's numbers at birth.

[^note5]: Lily inherited the sum total of her parents, plus an unexpected
    something extra.

[^note6]: Dudley is a male child from a human father and a squibbish nephil
    mother.  He stood a good chance of being born pure human.  Unfortunately, I
    need him to do a fair amount of "Harry Hunting."  He falls in that that 4%
    chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother. He has a *minuscule*
    ability to perceive that magic exists, and his only, barely rate-able,
    inheritance from the Seraphim, is a slight ability to feel when legilimency
    is being used around him.

[^note8]: We have next to no canonical information about Eileen Prince.  We know
    that she was either unable or unwilling to protect her sun from the muggle
    Tobias Snape.  I am assuming unable.  With that in mind, I have given her a
    range of abilities that left her week in the wand-based subjects,
    particularly where it comes to the types of magic that would allow her to
    protect her son most effectively.  She was probably good but not brilliant
    at Potions.

[^note7]: Snape is a potions prodigy.  He does his potions entirely
    instinctively, *and as such has no understanding of why other people do not
    find them just as easy*.  Snape is not just picking his ingredients
    precisely right, and augmenting them exactly as needed, he is even
    manipulating chemistry at an instinctual unconscious level so that his
    cauldrons and fires are exactly what the potion needs.  Snape has never
    needed an explanation of how to cut an ingredient, how to stir a potion,
    *why* one stirs one way versus another way, or any of the other myriad
    details of potion making.  He does not understand why anyone else might need
    these tedious lectures - they are self explanatory to anyone with half a
    brain.  The only reason why Lily outshines him in Slughorn's class is
    because: 

    1. he is essentially lazy.  The class comes easily to him, so he frequently
       tries just hard enough to show up everyone present *except* Lily (he does
       not care if she beats him)
    1. he is distracted by James and Sirius
       * partly by what they are doing to him
       * partly by what he is trying to do to them
    1. he is distracted *by __Lily__* whereas she feels only friendship for him
       and so is not distracted by him.

[^note9]: Riddle, as the male child of a near Squib, did not have great odds of
    being a powerful wizard.  That he is means that he was that 1% chance.
    These also represent numbers from at birth. Giving numbers from 1981 or
    later would, I think, be too much of a spoiler. 

If you compare Snape, James, and Lily, you will see that Snape and James are
almost precisely equal, except for their exact skill set, and that Lily is
actually *slightly* under-powered compared to both of them.  This matches what
Ollivander says of James' and Lily's wands, that James' has a little more power,
and yet makes Lily powerful enough to be scary. 

The other thing I have done is that the average of Riddle and Harry's abilities
are both an 8, so that while they have different specific abilities, they are in
a sense equally strong nephilim.  You will see that really Harry is a much
more balanced wizard, he has neither the highs nor the lows that Riddle has
(though neither is an especially strong Cherubim).  The one place that Harry
shines that Riddle does not is the Principalities - population effects.  This is
probably counter-intuitive.  Riddle works by intimidation, and while you *can*
intimidate populations, that is not actually what he does.  Instead he creates
atrocities, and allows his *actions* to act on the populace.  Remember that the
population effects from the Principalities are tied to locations, thus Harry is
unconsciously enhancing his environment with magics that affect the people
around him.  However, he will not find out that is happening until he has
travelled far enough to see what it looks like when people are *not* affected by
this magic. 

f you stack rank Riddle against Lily and James, the there are really four things
that make Riddle so scary. 

1. With an inheritance of 9 from the Seraphim, few people can defend against his
   legilimency, particularly when he employs it in mid duel.
1. With his maximised inheritance from the Thrones, nearly no-one can resist his
   Imperius Curse. In point of fact, Riddle is unconsciously bending other
   nephil to his will merely by being in their presence.
1. Few wizards (or witches) are as strong at *both* attack and defence (this is
   effectively two things, hence I said four total).

If you compare him to Harry, and in light of the above, I am going to get
complaints that I am either being inconsistent if I let Harry resist Riddle's
Imperius Curse, or that I'm ignoring cannon where Harry does just that.  There
are three possibilities, and I will probably actually go some combination of
them:

1. If you put the Goblet of Fire grave yard situation in this universe, then you
   would *not* just have Harry resisting Riddle, because Harry also has Lily's
   protection augmenting his capabilities.  Riddle never fully understood that
   protection, and taking Harry's blood does not fully bypass it. 
1. Lily's protection aside, you need to decide what theory of
   [[horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]] you are using, and what affect that theory has
   on Riddle's powers after the destruction of the diary.  For this work, I
   think that both the audience and the characters are in the dark about that
   answer, but suffice to say that one way or another, you cannot suffer the
   destruction of a [[horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]] you have created without
   *suffering.* 
1. In the books, Harry *learns* to resist the Imperius Curse, the fake Moody
   uses it several times on him before he can resist it easily.  Even then, it
   takes Harry noticeable effort to resist Riddle's when they meet in the
   graveyard.  This suggests that Harry's ability *is* less than Riddle's, but
   that Harry's is sufficiently strong that *with training* he can *learn* to
   stand up to Riddle. This last suggests that anyone with a score of 8 in the
   Thrones can be taught to resist Riddle's Imperius Curse.  That puts James,
   Dumbledore, and Snape at a level where they need not fear Riddle overwhelming
   them in the mind arts.
