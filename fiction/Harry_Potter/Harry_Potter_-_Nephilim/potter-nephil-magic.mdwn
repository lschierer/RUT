### Overall Rules

Nephil can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) for access to each class
of angelic abilities. For the purposes of this work, nephil can possibly inherit
the following:
* From the Seraphim, the ability to perceive the heart.  When used on other
  nephil, this allows access to information about the person's physical state,
  their will, and their memories.  When used on humans, it allows only access to
  information about the person's physical state.  However, an astute judge of
  human nature can combine this with situational awareness, historical
  information about the person, body language, and similar data to make highly
  accurate guesses. 
* From the Cherubim, the ability to perceive/detect what has been done with
  magic, and what is possible with it. 
* From the Thrones, the ability to bind the will of other nephilim.  For the
  purposes of this story, and *unlike cannon Harry Potter*, this ability has
  marginal *at best* affect on full humans. Things like the imperious curse or
  the confundus charm fit in here.  
* From the Dominions, the ability to transmute the form, but not the substance,
  of one thing to another.  This will be temporary unless the change is "locked"
  in place through combining this ability with that inherited from the Powers.
  Neither alone can make a transmutation permanent.  That is, the Powers cannot
  retroactively make a transmutation permanent, it must be done *as the change
  is made, by the same nephil*. 
* From the Virtues the ability to temporarily augment the nature of the natural
  world. Things like animation charms fit here. The other thing that fits here
  is that when a nephil who inherits from the Virtues handles certain raw
  materials (potions ingredients), these become "charged" with extra properties.
  This is a deviation from Mrs. Rowling's explanation for potions. 
* From the Powers, temporary & localised manipulation of the laws of physics and
  chemistry. 
* From the Principalities, the ability to create area effects on populations
  (unplottable, "muggle repelling", so on). This differs from the Thrones in
  that the gifts from the Thrones affect individuals regardless of location.
  The gifts from the Principalities affect whoever, full human or nephil, is in
  the right location to be affected, and no one who is not in relationship to
  that location.  Your ability to see into a place, remember a place, stay near
  a place, so on. 
* From the Archangels, offensive magics (recall that the nephilim come from
  fallen angels, so some of these offensive magics are corrupted and should not
  be used).  Now yes, all sorts of magic can be used to harm someone.  That is
  not what I mean.  I mean magics that have no other use. 
* From the angels, defensive magics (these can also be corrupted to the point of
  being dangerous to the user).  

Originally, centuries in the past, people tended to be highly specialised into
one of these.  Overall there is a 30% chance of a child mixing the
magical/angelic heritage of his/her parents.  While that might seem low, it is
compounded over the number of generations.  In practice, in the modern era,
every child invited to a magical school has a reasonably mixed heritage, though
the precise values 1-10 for each category differ significantly from child to
child. 

Harry Potter cannon breaks magic down into: 
* charms - generally a mix of inheritance from Virtues and Powers for the lower
  years, however
  - things like "cheering charms" are _actually_ a form of transmutation
    manipulating the form of brain chemicals, and thus, temporarily, their
    effect. 
  - memory charms like obliviation are a mix of transmutation on brain chemicals
    with the Seraphic ability to perceive (and thus target the transmutation
    really precisely). Because they are chemical in nature, they can work on full
    humans.  However, they can be more precisely targeted and more finely
    crafted/tuned when used against a nephil.  Thus you can make a human forget,
    say, the last hour, or the last day; you can make a nephil forget that a
    single person was present while otherwise remembering the event. 
  - Imperious curse acts differently on humans and nephil. Using the imperious
    curse on a human will require "operating" that human line you would a puppet
    or a remote control robot, while using it on a nephil acts more like what
    you see in the Harry Potter books, where you can give a command and the
    victim's own mind will assist in finding ways to carry out the order. 
  - Confundus type charms only work well on nephil, because they extend memory
    charms by depending on abilities inherited from Thrones. When used on a
    human, this charm interferes with the ability to form a long term memory,
    and the ability to retrieve long term memories, both for the duration of the
    charm, and it causes the various chemicals in the brain to surge.  So humans
    will tend to end up all sorts of confused, but without the fine grained
    control over what they are confused about, or what they think is actually
    happening that you can achieve with a nephil.  Note that not all nephil are
    *aware* of the difference in affect here. 
* transfiguration comes primarily from the Dominions, but is highly temporary
  unless you use abilities from the Virtues to augment reality to make a
  permanent change possible *as you make the change*. 
* conjuring requires inheritance from the Powers, as you are in essence
  manipulating quantum probabilities.  Unlike the standard Harry Potter,
  conjuration will tend to be permanent.
* Vanishing, though considered transfiguration, comes from the Powers, it is a
  form of dissolving something.  Because it is explained so poorly, students new
  to the practice will often actually attempt to modify the thing being
  vanished, resulting in transparent versions instead of something that has, to
  paraphrase McGonagall, gone into everything.
* Potions are complicated.   The magic comes in part from the brewer (primarily
  from the Virtues), and in part from the ingredients (different ingredients
  will react to your magical influence in different ways).  No two nephil will
  affect ingredients precisely the same way; similarly no two instances of the
  same ingredient are actually precisely the same.  A strong ability inherited
  from the Cherubim will make you more able to discern the effects of the
  ingredients, including between instances of supposedly identical ingredients.
  Thus the best potioneers strongly inherit from both the Cherubim and Virtues.
  Some potions additionally require chemical reactions not possible in nature,
  this requires the potioneer to have abilities in the Powers space as well.
  Lastly, if a potion is to be stored, rather than used immediately, the effects
  must be locked in place *at the time of creation* by mixing in some magic from
  the Dominions. Potions is a wandless art, though some traditions *do* use
  incantations as part of the process the potioneer trigger their magic.
  Hogwarts teaches potions in its hardest form: both wandless and silent,
  requiring near instinctual use of effectively three to four forms of magic
  simultaneously.  The nephil must use abilities inherited from the Virtues to
  augment the ingredients with additional properties, locking the augmentation
  in place using the transformative powers from the Dominions.  As this highly
  personal process will result in something slightly different from nephil to
  nephil, he/she must use abilities from the Cherubim to pick precisely the
  ingredients affected by his/her magic to precisely the right degree and in
  precisely the right way.  Should the ingredients not want to mix, the nephil
  then uses abilities inherited from the Powers to manipulate the laws of
  chemistry to make the reaction possible. The different ways and patterns of
  stirring are essentially mental triggers to help the nephil activate this
  chemical magic from the Powers.  This means that a potion recipe is more of a
  suggestion than a true recipe, the best will always come from deviating from
  the recipe by *just the right amount* to account for your personal magic and
  the specific ingredients you happen to be using in this particular instance. 
* Runes are also complicated.  Runes are _created_ from powers inherited from
  the Virtues, you augment reality to give your writing not just meaning, but
  power.  They are, however, *powered* by the inheritance related to the effect
  of the runes in question.  Thus two people equally skilled at creating runes
  might not be equally skilled at powering those runes, or vice versa. This is
  also a deviation from the cannon Harry Potter universe.  Runes can also be
  created to *absorb* power from the surrounding area to power connected
  sequences of runes, using abilities inherited from the Principalities.  This
  in practice reduces the effect of any attempt to use other powers in any way
  not connected to that rune sequence.  For a school like Hogwarts, it would be
  safer to practice your magic because the effect of each spell would be
  lessened.  The Hospital Wing would need to be shielded from most of the runes
  protecting the rest of the castle to ensure that you could still be cured
  using magic at full efficacy.  Overall, this effect would bluster Hogwart's
  reputation for being one of the safest places in Britain. 
* divination has two categories. 
  - prophesy is a morally suspect magic.  I am going to go with Biblical
    theology here; in divination the nephil knowingly or unknowingly
    communicates with fallen angels.  If they ever tell anything truthful, it is
    only because they judge it useful to lead us further into sin. Thus most
    prophesies are misleading, false, or both.  This fits well with what Mrs.
    Rowling writes in her original FAQ when she compared her series' prophecy to
    the one from _Macbeth_.[^20210902-5] 
  - Users particularly skilled in the abilities from the Seraphim may be able to
    use these abilities to make incredibly accurate predictions about people
    without crossing any lines.  Knowing that someone is clumsy from their
    memories, knowing that someone is afraid from their emotions, the user can
    predict some short term events and reactions in ways that might seem like
    divination.  Practices like palm reading, tea leaves, and crystal gazing
    grew from this magical insight into people.
  - There is some crossover between the two, generally to the detriment of both
    the user and any understanding of the truth. 
  - Users of the first form make future generations more susceptible to magics
    inherited from the Seraphim and Thrones (for four generations per my rules
    on nephil inheritance).  So while in general someone strong in the Thrones
    could normally resist the imperious curse, if they come from a family
    steeped in the use of divination, then he/she personally will be abnormally
    susceptible to this magic. 
* Arithmancy has a Wikipedia definition as being a speciality of divination.
  For my purposes this is _almost_ true.  For my purposes Arithmancy attempts to
  predict the effect of a use of magic.  It attempts to make magic scientific.
  However, it is complicated by the fact that its practitioners themselves do
  not actually understand the scientific method, nor agree on which mathematical
  system(s) they are using to do this in.  The field is dominated by people with
  only the vaguest idea of what the mundane world has done with either numbers
  or science in the past 200 years. 
* Legilimency - requires both an inheritance from the Seraphim and the Thrones,
  for this work it comes in 3 phases. 
  - Passively, it is solely from the Seraphim, and is morally neutral. This will
    tell you a target's emotional state (anything related to brain chemistry),
    whether or not the person is telling the truth (again based on brain
    chemistry and things like pulse rates, but done automatically for you by the
    magic), energy level/alertness, and other purely physical things but _not_
    about the person's actual thoughts or memories. A really skilled user may be
    able to infer thoughts from a however with a fair degree of accuracy. 
  - Communicatively, it adds in abilities from the Thrones, forcing the
    recipient to hear your thoughts. This is a bit of a grey area morally. 
  - Actively, you force the victim to reveal their memories, implant memories,
    or manipulate emotional states.  For some unknown reason, unless the target
    has at least some magic, you will be unable to do more than manipulate
    emotional states.  This manipulation goes beyond the simple transmutation of
    brain chemicals, it actually causes the brain to release the appropriate
    chemicals as if naturally in that emotional state. All active legilimency is
    morally repugnant, and comes at a magical cost.  Excessive use of this form
    of legilimency will have bizarre effects.  The effects may be physical,
    spiritual, mental, or any combination thereof. Per the above, what
    constitutes "excessive" has not been quantified.  To the extent that the use
    is not just excessive but also malicious and/or selfish (as opposed to
    defensive) in nature, the effects will not only be bizarre but hereditary,
    *and* will be coupled with reduced will-power in subsequent generations as
    is described in the section of magical inheritance for magics requiring
    emotional content. 
* Occlumency - the magical suppression of emotion and with that access to
  thoughts comes at a similar moral and magical cost to active legilimency. This
  will require inheritance from the Cherubim (for targeting), the Dominions (for
  transmuting brain chemicals), and the Seraphim (dealing with the non-material
  parts of men/nephil).  Lacking *any* of these will basically mean you are not
  going to succeed at Occlumency.  This story will offer magical defences to
  legilimency besides that of occlumency.

### Magical Inheritance: 

Since I need non-Mendelian inheritance to explain both magical creatures and the
nephilim themselves, I am going to set some rules.  These are primarily for the
nephilim, the inheritance for magical creatures may follow modified versions of
these rules depending on exactly how the creature in question came to exist.
These rules are hierarchical, that is you need to apply the rules in order to
determine what happens to a given child. 

1. Children born of at least one magical parent have a 80% chance of following
   these rules, and a 20% chance of following Mendelian genetics.  If they
   follow Mendelian genetics, any magical abilities will tend to degrade with
   each generation that follows Mendelian genetics. In other words, they will
   become more and more normal, more and more in line with the way the world
   would have worked without disruption or intervention.  
1. Children not following Mendelian genetics will have a 80% chance of still
   following Mendelian for traits not influenced by the deviation that
   distinguishes them from the mundane (in the nephilim this includes height,
   skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, so on). 
1. For every generation that a mundane trait *does not* follow Mendelian
   genetics, the odds that the next generation also will not increases by 10%.
   Thus things like Weasley red hair (many generations), or Potter hair (at
   least 3 generations) start to become non-mundane traits.
1. For non-mundane traits, a male child will have (a female child has similar
   numbers, but switch father/mother ).
    * a 50% chance of inheriting solely from his father, 
    * a 16% chance of inheriting the sum total of both parents, 
    * a 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,
    * a 7.5% chance of a partial inheritance from just his father, 
    * a 7% chance of inheriting solely from his mother, 
    * a 4% chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother,
    * a 1% chance of something truly bizarre happening
    * a 0.5% chance of becoming mundane,
1. Some uses of magic *requires* an emotional content (unforgivables require
   hatred, the patronus requires positive emotions, so on).  
    * Sufficient use of this magic predisposes the next generation to be
      susceptible to these emotions by 10% _per parent_.  
    * How much use qualifies as "sufficient" is insufficiently researched. 
    * Only magic that *requires* emotion does this.  Magic merely *affected* by
      emotion does not. 
    * This effect lasts for four generations.  
    * If the total effect exceeds 90% (at 100% you would have no free will),
      then the odds off something bizarre happening goes up by one percent for
      every 10% of difference.  So if for example all of your progenitors on
      both sizes excessively used the killing curse, you would be susceptible
      to hatred by 300% base, since the total effect cannot remove your free
      will, the actual effect is more complicated.  Your great-grandparents
      each had a 20% boost, but your grandparents inherited that 20% boost
      *from both sides* and *in addition* a 10% boost from each
      great-grandparent, for a total of a 60% boost.  Your parents were the
      first generation to exceed 90%: a 60% boost from each side plus 10% from
      each parent for a total of 140%.  This is reduced to 90%, but the chance
      of something bizarre is increased by 5%.  You then inherit 90% from each
      parent (180%) which is again reduced to 90%, but causes an additional
      boost on the chance of the bizarre, this time by 9%.  You are thus
      susceptible to hatred  by 90%, but the odds of something bizarre happening
      to you are the base  1% plus an additional 19% (5% from each parent plus
      9% from your own overflow) for a total of a 20% chance.
    * Inbreeding would make the above worse, as some progenitors would be
      counted twice over. 
    * Thus someone like Draco Malfoy actually does have tremendous trouble
      controlling his instinctual behaviour in many ways. Judged by human
      standards, he is mentally crippled, with severely damaged executive
      function, particularly in the areas of impulse control, aggression, and
      judgement. 
1. Harry Potter talks about two classes that require special mention, squibs and
   muggle born.  They are effectively inverse of each other. 
   * A true squib is the child who resulted from the 0.5% chance of becoming
     mundane.  Such a child is fully human, and no "muggle-born" will ever
     descend from such a child.
   * It is possible for a child receiving a partial inheritance from his or her
     parent(s) to have very low power.  On the scale of 1 to 10, in practice a
     child with a power level of 2 or below on all categories (see below) will
     be called a squib.  A child with 3 or below on all categories will not be
     invited to any magical school, but might be able to effectively use some
     magic.  A program like Kwick Spell might prey on such people.  
   * On a related note, a child with a 9 or a 10 in any category uses magic in
     that category instinctively.  A child with a 10 not only uses it
     instinctively, but with conscious control. [[Riddle]] did not have to be
     taught the Imperius Curse, learning it merely fine-tuned something he was
     already doing. 
   * Because it is possible (16% chance) for the parents' abilities to
     recombine, these "squibs" who are actually extremely low powered nephilim,
     can eventually produce higher powered children.  These children will
     *generally* be low powered (a mix of 3s, 4s and 5s in the various
     categories).  However, sometimes (1% chance) the something bizarre
     increases the child's ability beyond expectations. 
   * This partially explains some of the bias against these "first generation"
     magical users.  Not only are they new to a xenophobic culture, but marrying
     them *generally* creates a risk of low powered children.  With this
     background, being of "pure" blood is basically ignoring the 19.5% chance of
     being under powered as compared to your parents. Illogical, but considering
     other human prejudices, not unreasonable. 
   * Per the the above, it is possible for a pure human to gain magic through
     the union with a fallen angel.  In practice, this has not happened in
     centuries, but magical society remembers adults suddenly having magic where
     none had been present before.  From this comes stories of magic being
     "stolen."  This is not true of course, no one lost the magic the witch
     gained from her unholy union, but most magic users do not believe in
     angels, much less fallen angels, and have a strong distrust for the Church.

#### Specifically human/nephil 

* "Standard" nephilim seem more or less humans with extra abilities, but this is
  not really true. If you consider creation as a hierarchy, humanity has always
  occupied a messy place - top of the material creation, bottom of the spiritual
  order, but destined, through grace, not merit, to be raised above its (our)
  natural place.  Introducing the nephilim in this fictional world, I am putting
  the nephilim as being an unnatural hybrid of two things God created. In making
  this hybrid, something of each was lost. They are thus *slightly* lesser than
  humans. Despite having greater capabilities in some ways, they have deficits
  in others, most notably, they are overall *less free.*  Their choices are
  often constrained in ways that are not externally apparent, things that would
  be temptations to a human can be overriding compulsions to a nephil, and they
  are vulnerable to each other (and to others who can use similar powers) in
  ways that humans are not. 
* Per the above, it takes approximately six consecutive generations of magical
  abuse for "truly bizarre" things to become not just possible but probable.
   * In _The Screwtape Letters_, describes the effect of sin on the fallen
     angels.[^20210408-1] At the risk of adding *yet another* crossover to this
     story, this is at the heart of explaining what is happening in the
     following instances of something "truly bizarre" happening instead of
     explicable magical inheritance. Essentially these represent instances of
     Divine Justice.  
   * Building on what I wrote above comparing "standard humans" to nephil,
     beings in these categories are even more corrupted by the combination of
     sin and the inherent weakness of being of a race that was made, and not
     created. For lack of of a better word, they are more nearly animals, they
     *do* have immortal souls, but, to differing degrees (depending on species)
     lack even more of the free will that is already impaired in the nephilim. 
     This list is essentially ordered from most nearly equal to the nephilim to
     least nearly equal. 
   * mermen - These were once a magically powerful people who used inheritances
     from the Dominions to transmute themselves to survive the great Flood. They
     failed to consider that they might not be able to undo their own spells,
     and the effects were not only permanent, but inherited. They have lost the
     use of most magics through successive generations of partial inheritance
     despite the odds. In their quest to regain their human form, some groups
     did make progress, hence non-magical peoples have mythology about merfolk
     looking like a more literally half man half fish.  Between wars between
     tribes and wars between merfolk and other peoples, only those most capable
     of living fully submerged have survived. While mentally and spiritually
     most nearly equal to the nephilim from whom they (distantly) descend, their
     extreme physical changes, and near entire loss of magic means that they
     have little ability to form more than the most rudimentary societies in
     their fully aquatic environments. 
   * dwarfs - I really dislike what Mrs. Rowling did with the dwarfs in _the
     Chamber of Secrets_.[^20210518-1]  Since she says that goblins of all
     things are expert craftsmen,[^20210518-2] my take is that nephil became
     dwarfs became goblins.  I will figure out something else for Lockhart's
     cupids if I ever get that far in writing. 
   * goblins - people who are highly susceptible to greed, envy, and wrath.
     Their form has been distorted by the sins of their forefathers centuries
     ago.  They are still capable of good deeds, and some have been so highly
     virtuous as to have actually reduced their susceptibility from the 90%
     maximum to a more manageable 60-70 (this represents the *best* of goblin
     families), but the physical changes wrought on them have become "mundane,"
     and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  Despite their flaws, these
     populations retained their intelligence and their magic. They are
     particularly strong inheritors from the Virtues, Powers, and Archangels,
     with lesser inheritances from the Principalities and angels.
   * hags - a people who are consumed by envy and lust.  Their sins robbed their
     ancestors of all they can now value. They have particularly strong
     inheritances from the Thrones, reasonable inheritances from the Virtues
     and Powers.  Some have partial inheritances of random other types.
   * centaurs - a nearly primordial people (inheriting from both the the
     Seraphim and Cherubim) who selfishly abused divination magic until
     something truly bizarre happened.  They became nearly immune to the magic
     of the Dominions as practices by other mortals, but almost entirely ruled
     by subconscious influences of the angelic and nephilim from the surrounding
     areas, both those fallen and those who remained faithful.  They are also
     incredibly sensitive to the state of balance between them and human society.
     Whenever society takes a turn for the worse, so do they, whenever the
     societies they live near turn towards God, the centaur populations become
     more friendly.  However, as they remain addicted to divination, they never
     reconcile with the peoples the reside near. Their form comes from the fact
     that in their dependence on divination, they (as a people) adopted a herd
     mentality, and in a 1% chance freak event of Divine Justice, their form
     came to, in part, match their mentality. 
   * veela - a people who are consumed by lust.  For the purposes of this story,
     veela are "dark" creatures[^20210126-4] that have some of the strongest
     inheritances from the Thrones of all humanoid magic users.  A
     "half-veela" is a veela/human or veela/nephil cross where either the veela
     nature was, against the odds, only partially inherited; or the 16% chance
     that the veela nature is inherited in addition to a full nephil
     inheritance.   The pure veela is not however a true example of a primordial
     people.  In reality, the veela race comes from a cross from a really really
     strong primordial nephil of the Thrones type, with a primordial nephil of
     the Dominions type whose partial inheritance of those abilities means that
     the veela can only transmute really small molecules.  As a race, the veela
     combined these abilities in acts of true depravity, giving way to unbridled
     lust, and using their abilities to transmute to create pheromones, and
     their abilities to force the will to go beyond sexual temptation to enslave
     those they had maddened with lust.   These were a fallen people who took
     their powers as a license to abuse those weaker than them.  In this case
     their cumulative chance of the "something bizarre" rendered their
     behaviour a racial genetic trait, but also created a cruel, and highly
     ironic trap. The first prong of the trap, the veela is, unlike most
     nephilim, noticeably not fully human.  All veela have an avian animagus form
     that they are only partially in control over.  Involuntary transformation
     to the avian form is common when the veela becomes angered.  The second
     prong of the trap, if a veela falls in love, his or her magic implodes in a
     particularly harsh, and entirely involuntary way.  The *veela's* magic will
     cause the beloved to exert an effect on the veela to the same (except
     obviously inverted) extent as if the veela were, not just using but
     *pushing* his/her abilities to affect someone else.[^20210408-2] Because
     the veela's own magic is doing this, the other person cannot stop affecting
     the veela. Combined with the weakened will power that comes with abuse of
     mind magics, the veela is ill equipped to turn off his or her own magic and
     so the slaver becomes enslaved. This remains true of the "half-veela." Like
     _[Maskirovat][knffnm]_ I am going to speculate that the pure veela's
     lifespan is shorter than a normal human's, and fertility has shifted such
     that female births outnumber male births (most male sperm are simply not
     viable and so fewer males are conceived). If the half-veela falls in the
     16% total of both, he or she will inherit the greater of the two lifespans;
     if the 14% partial from both, the average of the two lifespans; otherwise
     lifespan follows either being veela or not being veela. The animagus-like
     transformation into an avian form is the result of a second 1% chance like
     event that became dominant in the veela race and is now effectively a
     permanent trait of all who inherit any portion of the veela nature. 
   * giants - a people who are consumed by wrath and sloth.  They neither build
     nor have any true culture as a result.  They have lost the use of nearly
     all magics through successive generations of partial inheritance, despite
     the odds.  Like the goblins the physical changes wrought on them by sin
     have become "mundane" and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  

### Other Races

Other "races" are not really people at all, they have varying levels of
intelligence, but are all effectively the same as meeting different qualities of
AI players, as if you were encountering cyborgs.  

* trolls - created by the extreme use of magics on apes, the *most* intelligent
  trolls might be able to perform similarly to a human with mental retardation
  capable of living in a group home. This is not a fair comparison however, the
  human is suffering from a disability; the troll is performing with unusual
  *capability.*  
* gnomes - created by the extreme use of magics on clay figures, these beings
  have no long term memory at all. 
* fairies/pixies/doxies - created by the extreme use of magics on (different)
  insects, these beings appear humanoid, but still reproduce by laying eggs like
  insects.  Unlike gnomes, they have some ability to form long term memories,
  but only very limited ability to learn from these experiences; their actions
  are guided by incredibly strong instinct rather than by reasoning. They are
  very like domesticated cats and dogs in this respect; a dog might remember its
  owner, but its behaviours will always be more governed by instinct than not.
* house elves - created by the extreme use of magics on an unknown mammal (not a
  human), they are the most nearly human of all created beings.  They are
  capable of learning, loyalty and betrayal; they have memories equivalent to
  ours.  They closely mimic having true free will, just as some human scientists
  speculate the highest animals do.  House elves were created with an innate
  *need* for *altruistic work*.  An idle elf will get sick and die.  Even levels
  of self-interest that would be normal and healthily in a human is also
  sufficient to cause a fatal illness in a house elf. Thus while they need not
  be magically bound to servitude as is traditional, they can at best be in an
  underpaid servant's position.  When bound, and elf can "feed" on the bond,
  using its master's magic to amplify its own. 

The creation of these "races" is an abomination, and the more nearly human, or
in other words the more perfectly the simulate free will, the greater the
abomination.  This will definitely have had *Screwtape* style bizarre on the
perpetrators of these crimes against creation and their descendants.  This is
true because of the moral confusion it causes - these "races" do not have
immortal souls the way humans, angels, nephil, or the nephil descended races do,
and yet they appear as if they should.  It is true because their creation mocks
the creation of man.  And lastly, it is true because their creation,
particularly that of the house elves and the trolls, has created groups that
exist at odds with true charity: in the case of the trolls a "race" that cannot
rise above rage, and in the case of the house elves a "race" that can never be
fully freed.
