## Harry Potter - Nephilim 
### Chapter 1

Vernon Dursley was a huge walrus of a man, with a large moustache and hardly
any neck. Although fundamentally a bully by nature, Vernon would never dream of
crossing his wife, Petunia.  It was not that she was physically intimidating.
Almost anorexic woman, with a rather horsey face, you might have been
excused for thinking her the victim and Vernon the aggressor.  Instead,
deep down (as much as he denied it even to himself), he secretly dreaded
her shrewish temper.  He did all he could to accommodate her obsessions,
while fully sharing her small minded bigotry, and petty hatreds.  Thus when
they found their nephew on their doorstep one morning, the only real question
was just how bad things would get.

The Dursleys were not monsters, nor was Dumbledore in sending Harry to them
The Dursleys did not take in their nephew and immediately start plotting
all the ways they would keep his spirits down, or how they would keep him
ignorant of his heritage.  Dumbledore's note included no spells to create
animosity, no injunctions to be strict.  Petunia may have been sincerely
displeased to see Harry on her doorstep, but her *initial* reaction was to
do reasonably decent by him.

The problem was that Harry's world had been shattered.  When he woke, he
started crying for his parents.  This was an unpleasant reminder of the sister
Petunia wanted to forget.  When he would wake in the middle of the night,
her irritation gave Vernon license to take out some of his aggression on
the toddler.  And so, Harry moved from the smallest bedroom where he could
be heard crying at night, to the cupboard under the stairs, where his cries
were muffled.

Once he was in the cupboard, a slow but steady cascade effect started.
At first Harry was fed and changed fairly regularly.  However, for many
children, the evening hours are something of a fussy time, as mum starts
to look towards dinner preparations, and that afternoon nap was not really
*quite* enough to produce a child ready to self-entertain.  Dudley was not
inclined to self-entertain ever.  Left to his own devices while Petunia
worked on dinner, Dudley immediately began fussing.  When Petunia did not
immediately give him the attention he wanted, he turned vengefully on Harry.
If Dudley was not happy, no one could be happy.  By the time Vernon would get
home, both boys would inevitably be upset.  Vernon might find this laudable
in Dudley - "Little tyke knows how to stand up for himself," but the same was
not true of Harry.  Vernon took to tossing the small boy into the cupboard.
Harry quickly learned that if he wanted to be fed at all in the evenings,
he needed to self-sooth and silence his tears, no matter how much he hurt.

It should have been a short, one sided victory, but for the well-intentioned
meddling of an old fool with an over inflated ego.  Lily was not expecting
to have to fight at all.  The ritual was supposed to have killed Voldemort.
James death to allow her to remain on earth long enough to reflect one
curse, and then Voldemort would descend to Hell, while she joined James
to face Judgement, trusting in the words from Scripture - "No greater
gift ...".[^20201214-1] Still, while the monster had stronger magic, her
soul was undamaged.  So it *should* have been an easy victory, once she
recovered from the shock, and marshalled her strength to fight back at all.
Before she could however, a second shock hit.  It was is if a chain settled
around her, pulling at her, sapping her magic, granting the monster something
like parity against her.  Dumbledore had set up protections, intending to
use the relationship between Harry and Petunia, not knowing that Lily's soul
was present.  Instead, the protections used Lily's magic, but because she
was dead, because she had no body to fuel that magic, instead of being a
negligible drain, it cost her almost everything.  Instead of being able to
eject Voldemort, she was now hard pressed to merely keep his soul shard at bay.

Harry landed hard in the cupboard, and something snapped in his arm.
His infant cries should have alerted his aunt and uncle that something was
wrong, but Vernon had had a bad day, and Petunia was not feeling well and had
gone to bed as soon as Vernon got home.  Not really being alive, and doing
her best to not only keep Voldemort from affecting Harry, but to keep *her
own* presence from affecting him, Lily had trouble with concepts like time.
Souls, being immaterial, have very little to do with time, it is our bodies
that allow us to experience the passage of each second in a meaningful way.
And so it was several hours later when Lily realised that Vernon and Petunia
were not taking Harry to the hospital.  Her son needed help, or he would
face a night of pain, and probably worse in the morning.

She healed him, carefully using as little magic as possible - the chains
created by the protective magic on the house left her so very little.
As small as it was, it was almost too much.  Voldemort sensed the shift,
and struck.  Lily parried his attack, but Harry suffered the first of many
nightmares, forced to relive the night his parents had died.

Months passed.  A pattern formed.  Harry was missing at least one meal a day
(sometimes more on weekends), and there would be an injury for Lily to heal
any time Vernon had a bad day - on average once a week. Petunia would not
let Vernon hurt Harry in front of her, but would turn a blind eye to any of
Dudley's misdeeds, and to the occasional rough handling and Harry was "sent"
to the cupboard.  Vernon picked up on this, and started to encourage Dudley's
misbehaviour.  Every time Lily had to heal Harry, he suffered nightmares.
Between continuing to miss his parents, the lack of attention, the lack of
food, the pain, and the nightmares, Harry started to cycle into depression.

In very young children, depression commonly takes the form of an unnaturally
silent and withdrawn child, and in delays in reaching milestones.  Harry came
to the Dursleys somewhat ahead for his age, and so, by the end of his first
year with the Dursleys, he had turned into a quiet child, but otherwise rather
average.  Lily continued to suffer from an inability to realise how much time
was passing, but she did realise that Harry was not getting the attention
he needed in more than just needing healing.  What can a disembodied soul
with very little spare magic do though?  Rather than fight a losing battle
trying to heal Harry's wounded psyche in the face of continual assault,
Lily took a different approach.

The primary problem, as Lily saw it, was that every time she turned aside
from battling Voldemort to heal Harry, it backfired because the diversion of
power made him vulnerable to Voldemort.  Worse, she realised that he was using
legilimancy in his attacks on Harry.  Diseased she saw clearly something that
was only hinted at in books on the mind magics - anything beyond so-called
"passive legilimancy" where only the emotional state of the target was
observed came with risks to *both* caster *and* target.  She might be able
to teach Harry to heal himself physically, but inevitably there would be a
magical cost to the way legilimancy repeatedly linked her son with his foe.
What form that cost would take she did not know, but it could not be good.

Moreover, he really needed protection from the mental effects of his spiralling
depression, something it was unrealistic to expect him to help himself with.
Seeing her death over and over again in his dreams on top of the constant
neglect was too much for any child to take.  Thus he needed to be able to
help her hold off Voldemort while she did any required healing.  That way
the more he grew, the more he could help, the more she could do, creating a
positive feedback loop in place of the negative one she was currently fighting.

She started setting up shields, similar to the effects of occlumency, but
in substance very different.  True occlumency would have been useless -
Voldemort was already inside Harry's head.  What was needed was to *truly*
empty Harry's mind, to separate that which made Harry himself from that
which the soul shard could influence or even detect.  To an observer, these
shields created an effect that mimicked a child with a dissociative disorder:
Harry became *even more* withdrawn, and seemed to not even notice the abuse
Dudley (and sometimes Vernon) heaped upon him. It was as if each part of
his physical brain was split in two, one that controlled his body and was
vulnerable to the shard, one that remained in tune with her son's soul and
remained part of his mind and thoughts.

For Harry however, something very different was happening.  Harry was
becoming more and more aware of the spiritual world around him.  Being a
nephil, Harry was a hybrid of the purely spiritual angels and the humans
who are themselves hybrids between the spiritual and the physical, but who
are limited to mostly physical senses (some saints have had more abilities
granted due to grace, but that's the exception).  As he became more aware of
the spiritual, he also became more aware of the battle continuously fought
between a warm light presence and a dark malevolent presence within him.
Even as the external, physical world became, not less real (dissociated),
but rather less important, the spiritual world was becoming more visible and
thus more important.  Harry could see that he was not alone, that something
was fighting for him, helping and healing him when it could, and fighting,
constantly fighting to keep him from something far scarier and far worse
than anything that Dudley or Vernon could do.

This was not really legilimancy, it was too unformed, unfocused, and
uncontrolled to really be called that.  Harry had no access to a person's
memories, and only the most superficial sense of their emotional state.
And yet, Harry could see Lily and Voldemort-sliver battling; he now also saw
the people around him, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, and occasionally
Mrs. Figg as souls attached to bodies, the difference being that they each only
had one, where there seemed to be two extras constantly with him.  One that
loved him, and one that hated him.  And so Harry knew that Aunt Petunia did
not *really* hate him, he could see that her anger was very different than
Uncle Vernon's or the dark thing's.  And no matter now hard his life was,
Harry also knew he was loved.  The bright soul was there, and it loved him.
Now all he had to do was find another soul, an embodied soul, that might also
love him.  He was not really sure how he knew that such a soul was out there
somewhere, but the bright soul made it clear, without words, that he would find
it someday. It was not that Harry was *actually* as unaware of the world around
him as he seemed; but the shields Lily created did make the physical world and
his physical pain seem ... slight distant, and certainly less real than the
spiritual battle he was a constant witness to.  The dark thing did not just
want to take over, it wanted to *destroy* everything that made him *himself*.
When your very soul is at stake, who cares about a few merely physical pains?

These were big thoughts for a two year old, and so naturally Harry did
not fully understand them.  Still, adults would be surprised how much even
really young children can understand, even if they do not have the words to
express it.  Roald Dahl knew that, as did C. S. Lewis - that is why adults
find their books scarier than children do.

[^20201214-1]: The idea that James and Lily used a ritual sacrifice to save
    Harry comes from PetrificusSomewhatus's _[Daphne Greengrass and the Importance Of Intent](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23986264?view_full_work=true)_.
    While I've reused the concept, my idea of the ritual is probably very different
    from the one intended by that work.  The idea that the ritual would be hidden
    in actions that Voldemort would not recognise as such comes from Clell65619's
    _[A Mother's Love](https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/A_Mothers_Love/)_.
    Here I'm using the concept fairly similarly to the way
    the original author did.  The idea of Lily being embedded
    in Harry's scar comes from kokopelli's _[The Unexpected Horcrux](https://kokopelli.nsns.fanficauthors.net/The_Unexpected_Horcrux)_
    where again I am mutating the idea from the original. The idea that Lily
    would help Harry to learn is also used in Lady FoxFire's 
    _[Justice Served With A Side Of Fries](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6300111)_ 
    though I think I came up with my version before I read that story.
