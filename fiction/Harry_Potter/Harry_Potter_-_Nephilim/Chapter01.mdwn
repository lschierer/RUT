== Harry Potter - Nephilim
=== Chapter 1

Vernon Dursley was a huge walrus of a man, with a large moustache and hardly any neck. Although fundamentally a bully by nature, Vernon would never dream of crossing his wife, Petunia.  It was not that she was physically intimidating.  Almost anorexic woman, with a rather horsey face, you might have been excused for thinking her the victim and Vernon the aggressor.  Instead, deep down (as much as he denied it even to himself), he secretly dreaded her shrewish temper.  He did all he could to accommodate her obsessions, while fully sharing her small minded bigotry, and petty hatreds.  Thus when they found their nephew on their doorstep one morning, the only real question was just how bad things would get.
