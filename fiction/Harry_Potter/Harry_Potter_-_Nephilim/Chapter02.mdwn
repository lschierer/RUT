## Harry Potter - Nephilim
### Chapter 2

Harry's prioritisation of the spiritual over the physical exposed him to his mother's love; it also exposed him to Voldemort's hate.  On the whole though, the knowledge that he was in fact loved was a net positive, and like Lily hoped, the depression spiral ceased.  *Unfortunately* there was very little in the physical world that was of any interest to the neglected, attention-starved boy.  Aunt Petunia may not actively hate him, but she certainly did not want to be reminded of her sister more than was really necessary.  As Harry grew and learned to be more self sufficient, he also learned to be more and more introverted and silent.  It was better that way.  Being rarely seen and never heard was the best way to avoid Vernon's ire, Dudley's bored abuse, and even annoying Aunt Petunia with disconcerting green stare.  

Children are remarkably resilient, and magical children even more so, but by the time Harry turned four, he was going months without talking. There was simply no one for him to really talk to on any regular basis.  Lily's lack of any real sense of time was acting against him, this was not someone actively harming him, it was just a gradual lack of activity.  Atrophy of the vocal cords and the muscles around them is something that doctors usually only see, if they see it at all, in the elderly.  Children normally either have or create plenty of opportunity to talk and thus exercise their voices.  Harry was quickly falling into that rare exception case, unfortunately there was no one to notice as his voice became breathy and high pitched, even for a young child.  Having learned within weeks that crying out just caused problems, Harry never tried for high volume, so no one noticed that it was less and less possible for him to yell.  He so rarely said anything more than "thank you Aunt Petunia." or "Yes Uncle Vernon" that his vocal fatigue went unremarked, even by himself.[^20201214-2] 

Dumbledore had worried that this effectively undocumented child might make waves in muggle society and had taken steps to prevent that.  As Harry started school at age five, teachers would take notice of the small boy in ill fitting clothing who could barely talk, but then would forget before they would remember to file official reports about it.  As Dudley was exposed to a wider audience, Petunia and Vernon needed a new form of denial to deal with the resulting problems.  Reports that Dudley was a bully got transferred to Harry in their minds, and when they subconsciously realised that might not be sufficient, Petunia started a campaign to have the neighbourhood blame Harry for Dudley's misdeeds as well.  Up until this point Petunia could honestly say she did not hate Harry.  But as she convinced herself that he was a miscreant, bullying other children, causing problems for Dudley in school, she turned against him.  There was really no choice.  The alternative was to face up to the disaster that was her own son.  She could not do that. 

In his first year of school, Harry happened to honestly be sick and miss class the day they had a presentation about talking to adults about abuse.  It never occurred to him to do so spontaneously.  In his second year of school, he tried, but was disappointed - the teacher could not remember their conversation the next day.  Indeed, she barely seemed to remember *him* at all. Something odd was clearly going on.  Harry noticed, and more, Lily noticed.

It took some time.  She could not spare much magic for diagnostic spells, and even when she could, she would forget just how quickly time was passing for Harry.  He kept asking though, and eventually Lily realised that someone official had placed some variant of the spells that prevent humans from noticing the Leaky Cauldron or Platform 9Â¾ on Harry.  The number of people who could have done so, would have done so, was vanishingly small.  A "muggle-born" herself, she knew there was no reason for the Ministry of Magic to have done so.  It had to have something to do with his placement with the Dursleys instead of with Sirius or the Longbottoms as her Will had specified should have happened.  Figuring out who, however, was less important than figuring out what to do next.
