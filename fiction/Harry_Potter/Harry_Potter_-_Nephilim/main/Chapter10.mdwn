Cannon Chapter Seven, and parts of Cannon Chapter Eight, since Harry will not
actually attend class at first.  Harry is sorted to Hufflepuff because the Hat
sees that his ambitions are all around finding and creating a
family.[^20210615-1]  The school is confused, because no one saw him until the
Hat yells out Hufflepuff, which is enough to disrupt his invisibility.  The
experience of so many people looking at him freaks Harry out and he flees the Hall.

    not remember having read this story before thinking of this myself.
