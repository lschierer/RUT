Dudley is a male child from a human father and a squibbish nephil mother.  He
stood a good chance of being born pure human.  Unfortunately, I need him to do a
fair amount of "Harry Hunting."  He falls in that that 4% chance of a partial
inheritance from just his mother.

He has a *minuscule* ability to perceive that magic exists, and his only, barely
rate-able, inheritance from the Seraphim, is a slight ability to feel when
legilimency is being used around him.
