## Harry Potter - Nephilim

I recently read _[Many Waters][MW]_ by Madeleine L'Engle.  Her theology in that
book is *really really* sketchy, but like many distortions of true Catholic
thought, makes for interesting fiction.  It occurred to me that while I have no
real interest in doing a true crossover with her works, that it would be fun to
cross over some of the (fake) theology from this book with the Harry Potter
series.  L'Engle, in her book, extends one of the two theories for understanding
the term *[nephilim][^20201209-1]* from the Old Testament. Specifically, she
takes the view that the those angels that rebelled against God had intercourse
with human women.  A lot of authors will try to do almost all their world
building within the narrative.  I realise this is technically better, but it is
also harder to do.  Since I am doing essentially a 3 way cross over between
Harry Potter, Many Waters, and actual Catholic theology, I am going to set the
stage here in this introduction.  These world building notes are useful to
understand the story, but are hopefully not truly necessary.  That being said, I
am not going to go out of my way to explain in depth the way some authors do, I
will just include it either here, or in an appendix. 

Some points of divergence from her ideas:

* she calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox theology
  and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil (I'm
  using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil - nephilim). 
* she has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old
  Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am
  positing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament
  times. 
* Because she does not fully flesh out nephil, and because it fit the story I
  wanted to tell, I am pulling in *yet another* element to this story: One
  section of the _The Screwtape Letters_ describes the effect of sin on the
  fallen angels.[^20210408-1]  At various places I talk about "bizarre" things
  happening to nephil.  This is more or less what I envision.  Essentially these
  represent instances of Divine Justice. 

Some ideas I am specifically pulling:

* being seduced by a fallen angel is not just a matter of falling in love with
  the wrong person, the fallen angel also seduces you into an evil ritual that
  corrupts your soul. I am going to extend this and call such a person a witch.
  See below for deviations from Harry Potter.
* the fallen angels directly interact with humanity and have visible
  manifestations of the powers they retain from their angelic nature.  I'm
  extending this to say that some of these are inherited.

Some points of divergence from Harry Potter:

* I am breaking my own rules with [[Harry|Harry_Potter/Notes/Harry]]'s
  character, he will be noticeably out of character in this story. 
* Witches are those corrupted by union with fallen angels.  They do gain power
  (magic) from this union, but are corrupted by it.  Should they repent and
  receive forgiveness from their sins, they would also lose their access to
  magic.
* Following from the origin of magic I'm using, magic will follow somewhat
  different [[rules|potter-nephil-magic]] than the Harry Potter books.  This
  includes both the way the characters use magic and magical creatures. 
* Modern day welders of magic, heavily influenced by paganism and by those who
  have given into temptation, have obscured the difference between those who
  inherit magic and those who have gained it through sin. They call all female
  welders of magic witches, this is part denial, part self delusion, and part
  ignorance. Exactly how much of which differs from person to person. 
* The Old Testament references to witches refer to those corrupted by union with
  fallen angels, not to the children of such unions (This is almost certainly
  bogus and entirely fictional theology, but it is necessary for world
  building).
* The Statue of Secrecy was imperfectly implemented.  At one point, knowledge of
  the a-fore bullet points was commonly taught to most clergy.  With the
  disruptions to the education of clergy wrought by the enlightenment, and
  worse, by the modern era, now only a few priests and bishops know this
  history. 
* Per the above, I am asserting a historical fiction: witch hunting was a
  product of ignorance (sometimes poorly educated priests yes) and even more so
  of Protestantism.  The rejection of those parts of Sacred Tradition not
  contained in the Bible by Protestants caused them to reject the true
  understanding of the interactions between the fallen angels and humanity.
* Magic users *are not human.*  Just like a hippogriff is a blend of the
  incompatible horse and eagle that is not fully one nor the other, the person
  who can use magic is a nephilim, not a human.  
   * As a distortion of God's creation, nephilim do not, cannot fit cleanly into
     either creation or Divine Law. [Soteriology][WP1], [Missiology][WP2], and
     [Ecclesiology][WP3] get interesting (and fictional) curlicues and footnotes
     trying to deal with the chaotic fallout of the interaction between the
     angelic and the human in a nephil's nature.  This lets me do things to/with
     the characters that would not otherwise be at all moral. 
   * Just as a hippogriff is impossible by normal genetics, and cannot be
     explained by Mendelian inheritance patterns, children of either two nephil
     or one human and one nephil do not follow purely Mendelian inheritance
     patterns.
* I intended this long before I read this in any other work, but I intend that
  faith, prayer, the Sacraments, and sacramentals will all have actual
  effects.[^20210412-5]
