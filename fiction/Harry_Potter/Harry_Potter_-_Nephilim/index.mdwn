## Harry Potter - Nephilim

### Introduction

I recently read _[Many Waters][MW]_ by Madeleine L'Engle.  Her theology in that book is *really really* sketchy, but like many distortions of true Catholic thought, makes for interesting fiction.  It occurred to me that while I have no real interest in doing a true crossover with her works, that it would be fun to cross over some of the (fake) theology from this book with the Harry Potter series.  L'Engle, in her book, extends one of the two theories for understanding the term *[nephilim][^20201209-1]* from the Old Testament. Specifically, she takes the view that the those angels that rebelled against God had intercourse with human women.  A lot of authors will try to do almost all their world building within the narrative.  I realise this is technically better, but it is also harder to do.  Since I am doing essentially a 3 way cross over between Harry Potter, Many Waters, and actual Catholic theology, I am going to set the stage here in this introduction.  These world building notes are useful to understand the story, but are hopefully not truly necessary.  That being said, I am not going to go out of my way to explain in depth the way some authors do, I will just include it either here, or in an appendix. 

Some points of divergence from her ideas:

* she calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox theology and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil (I'm using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil - nephilim). 
* she has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am positing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament times. 

Some ideas I am specifically pulling:

* being seduced by a fallen angel is not just a matter of falling in love with the wrong person, the fallen angel also seduces you into an evil ritual that corrupts your soul. I am going to extend this and call such a person a witch.  See below for deviations from Harry Potter.
* the fallen angels directly interact with humanity and have visible manifestations of the powers they retain from their angelic nature.  I'm extending this to say that some of these are inherited.

Some points of divergence from Harry Potter:

* Witches are those corrupted by union with fallen angels.  They do gain power (magic) from this union, but are corrupted by it.  Should they repent and receive forgiveness from their sins, they would also lose their access to magic.
* Modern day welders of magic, heavily influenced by paganism, and by those who have given into temptation, have obscured the difference between those who inherit magic and those who have gained it through sin. They call all female welders of magic witches, this is part denial, part self delusion, and part ignorance. Exactly how much of which differs from person to person. 
* The Old Testament references to witches refer to those corrupted by union with fallen angels, not to the children of such unions (This is almost certainly bogus and entirely fictional theology, but it is necessary for world building).
* The Statue of Secrecy was imperfectly implemented.  At one point, knowledge of the a-fore bullet points was commonly taught to most clergy.  With the disruptions to the education of clergy wrought by the enlightenment, and worse, by the modern era, now only a few priests and bishops know this history. 
* Per the above, I am asserting a historical fiction: witch hunting was a product of ignorance (sometimes poorly educated priests yes) and even more so of Protestantism.  The rejection of those parts of Sacred Tradition not contained in the Bible by Protestants caused them to reject the true understanding of the interactions between the fallen angels and humanity.
* Magic users *are not human.*  Just like a hippogriff is a blend of the incompatible horse and eagle that is not fully one nor the other, the person who can use magic is a nephilim, not a human.  
	 * As a distortion of God's creation, nephilim do not, cannot fit cleanly into either creation or Divine Law. [Soteriology][WP1], [Missiology][WP2], and [Ecclesiology][WP3] get interesting (and fictional) curlicues and footnotes trying to deal with the chaotic fallout of the interaction between the angelic and the human in a nephil's nature.  This lets me do things to/with the characters that would not otherwise be at all moral. 
	 * Just as a hippogriff is impossible by normal genetics, and cannot be explained by Mendelian inheritance patterns, children of either two nephil or one human and one nephil do not follow purely Mendelian inheritance patterns.

### Magical Inheritance: 

Since I need non-Mendelian inheritance to explain both magical creatures and the nephilim themselves, I am going to set some rules.  These are primarily for the nephilim, the inheritance for magical creatures may follow modified versions of these rules depending on exactly how the creature in question came to exist. These rules are hierarchical, that is you need to apply the rules in order to determine what happens to a given child. 

1. Children born of at least one magical parent have a 80% chance of following these rules, and a 20% chance of following Mendelian genetics.  If they follow Mendelian genetics, any magical abilities will tend to degrade with each generation that follows Mendelian genetics. In other words, they will become more and more normal, more and more in line with the way the world would have worked without disruption or intervention.  
1. Children not following Mendelian genetics will have a 80% chance of still following Mendelian for traits not influenced by the deviation that distinguishes them from the mundane (in the nephilim this includes height, skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, so on). 
1. For every generation that a mundane trait *does not* follow Mendelian genetics, the odds that the next generation also will not increases by 10%.  Thus things like Weasley red hair (many generations), or Potter hair (at least 3 generations) start to become non-mundane traits.
1. For non-mundane traits, a male child will have (a female child has similar numbers, but switch father/mother ).
    * a 50% chance of inheriting solely from his father, 
    * a 16% chance of inheriting the sum total of both parents, 
    * a 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,
    * a 7.5% chance of a partial inheritance from just his father, 
    * a 7% chance of inheriting solely from his mother, 
    * a 4% chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother,
    * a 1% chance of something truly bizarre happening
    * a 0.5% chance of becoming mundane,
1. Some uses of magic *requires* an emotional content (unforgivables require hatred, the patronus requires positive emotions, so on).  
    * Sufficient use of this magic predisposes the next generation to be susceptible to these emotions by 10% _per parent_.  
    * How much use qualifies as "sufficient" is insufficiently researched. 
    * Only magic that *requires* emotion does this.  Magic merely *affected* by emotion does not. 
    * This effect lasts for four generations.  
    * If the total effect exceeds 90% (at 100% you would have no free will), then the odds off something bizarre happening goes up by one percent for every 10% of difference.  So if for example all of your progenitors on both sizes excessively used the killing curse, you would be susceptible to hatred by 300% base, since the total effect cannot remove your free will, you are susceptible to hatred by 90%, but the odds of something bizarre happening to you are the base 1% plus an additional 21% for a total of 22% chance.

#### Specifically human/nephil 

* nephil can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) for access to each class of angelic abilities.
* For the purposes of this work, nephil can possibly inherit the following:
   * From the Seraphim, the ability to perceive the hearts of men (and nephilim)
   * From the Cherubim, the ability to perceive/detect what is done with these abilities
   * From the Thrones, the ability to transmute the form, but not the substance, of one thing to another
   * From the Dominions, the ability to bind the will of other nephilim.  For the purposes of this story, and *unlike cannon Harry Potter*, this ability has marginal *at best* affect on full humans.  
   * From the Virtues the ability to temporarily augment the nature of the natural world
   * From the Powers, temporary & localised manipulation of the laws of physics and chemistry
   * From the Principalities, the ability to create area effects on populations (unplottable, "muggle repelling", so on)
   * From the Archangels, offensive magics (recall that the nephilim come from fallen angels, so some of these offensive magics are corrupted and should not be used)
   * From the angels, defensive magics (these can also be corrupted to the point of being dangerous to the user)
* Originally, centuries in the past, people tended to be highly specialised into one of these.  However, overall there is a 30% chance of a child mixing the magical/angelic heritage of his/her parents.  In practice, in the modern era, every child has a highly mixed heritage, though the precise values 1-10 for each category differ significantly from child to child.  
* Harry Potter cannon breaks magic down into 
   * charms - generally a mix of inheritance from Virtues and Powers for the lower years, however things like "cheering charms" are _actually_ a form of transmutation manipulating the form of brain chemicals, and thus, temporarily, their effect. 
   * transfiguration is primarily from Thrones
   * conjuring requires inheritance from the Powers, as you are in essence manipulating quantum probabilities. 
   * Vanishing, though considered transfiguration, comes from the Powers, it is a form of dissolving something.  Because it is explained so poorly, students new to the practice will often actually attempt to modify the thing being vanished, resulting in transparent versions instead of something that has, to paraphrase McGonagall, gone into everything.  
   * Potions is the use of abilities from the Powers to trigger effects in either that, *or another* category of magic in delayed ways (typically when the potion is consumed).  
   * Alchemy is the attempt to make a transmutation affect not just the form but the substance.  In practice Alchemy is almost entirely coming from the Powers, but happening at the subatomic level.  Things like the Elixir of life are not *really* Alchemical at all, they are really potions only possible with the use of elements that can only be created/obtained through the use of Alchemical processes.  
   * Runes are like potions, ways of triggering effects without actively using your own resources at that precise time. 
   * divination is a morally suspect magic.  I am going to go with Biblical theology here; in divination the nephil knowingly or unknowingly communicates with fallen angels.  If they ever tell anything truthful, it is only because they judge it useful to lead us further into sin. Users of this magic make future generations more susceptible to magics inherited from the Seraphim and Dominions (for four generations per above).  Thus most prophesies are misleading, false, or both. 
   * Arithmancy has a wikipedia definition as being a speciality of divination.  For my purposes this is _almost_ true.  For my purposes Arithmany attempts to predict the effect of a use of magic.  It attempts to make magic scientific.  However, it is complicated by the fact that its practitioners themselves do not actually understand the scientific method, nor agree on which mathematical system(s) they are using to do this in.  The field is dominated by people with only the vaguest idea of what the mundane world has done with either numbers or science in the past 200 years.  
    * Legilimency - requires both an inheritance from the Seraphim and the Dominions, for this work it comes in 3 phases.  
       * Passively, it is solely from the Seraphim, and is morally neutral. This will tell you a target's emotional state (anything related to brain chemistry), whether or not the person is telling the truth (again based on brain chemistry and things like pulse rates, but done automatically for you by the magic), energy level/alertness, and other purely physical things but _not_ about the person's actual thoughts or memories. A really skilled user may be able to infer thoughts from a combination of this information and the subject/target's actions however with a fair degree of accuracy.  
       * Communicatively, it adds in abilities from the Dominions, forcing the recipient to hear your thoughts. This is a bit of a grey area morally.  This shows in that its effects are, unlike most magic with moral content, irregularly inherited.  The more welcome, and the less forced, your thoughts are to the "listener", the effects of using this magic become less inherited by future generations.  Where the use of the killing curse is not just a mortal sin, it also affects the amount of free will available to your children, this magic has primarily bizarre effects on your own mind and will, and on the mind and will of those you primarily use it on.  Elaborating here would quickly become a spoiler for the story.  While some fanfiction has suggested that legilimancy could be used to implant memories or manipulate a target's emotions, I will not go there *directly*. 
       * Actively, you force the victim to reveal their thoughts.  This is morally repugnant, and comes at a magical cost.  Excessive use of this form of legilimency will impact future generations.  Per the above, what constitutes "excessive" has not been quantified.  
    * Occlumency - the magical suppression of emotion and with that access to thoughts comes at a similar moral and magical cost to active legilimency.  This work will offer magical defences to legilimency that besides occlumency.  
* "truly bizarre" things include the birth of 
   * goblins - people who are highly susceptible to greed, envy, and wrath.  Their form has been distorted by the sins of their forefathers centuries ago.  They are still capable of good deeds, and some have been so highly virtuous as to have actually reduced their susceptibility from the 90% maximum to a more manageable 60-70 (this represents the *best* of goblin families), but the physical changes wrought on them have become "mundane," and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  Despite their flaws, these populations retained their intelligence and their magic. 
   * giants - a people who are consumed by wrath and sloth.  They neither build nor have any true culture as a result.  They have lost the use of nearly all magics through successive generations of partial inheritance, despite the odds.  Like the goblins the physical changes wrought on them by sin have become "mundane" and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  
   * hags - a people who are consumed by envy and lust.  Their sins robbed their ancestors of all they can now value. 
   * mermen - one of the few cases of a true 1% chance on top of 1% chance resulting in a different species.  They have lost the use of most magics through successive generations of partial inheritance despite the odds. 
   * veela - a people who are consumed by lust.  For the purposes of this story, veela are "dark" creatures[^20210126-4] that have some of the strongest inheritances from the Dominions of all humanoid magic users.  A "half-veela" is a veela/human or veela/nephil cross where the veela nature was, against the odds, only partially inherited.  A pure veela is an example of the primordial highly specialized magic user, with power in only a single category (Dominions obviously).  
   * centaurs - a primordial people who abused divination magic until something truly bizarre happened.  They became nearly immune to the magic of the Dominations as practices by other mortals, but almost entirely ruled by subconscious influences of the angelic hosts, both those fallen and those who remained faithful.  They are thus incredibly sensitive to the state of balance between them in society.  Whenever society takes a turn for the worse, so do they, whenever the societies they live near turn towards God, the centaur populations become more friendly.  However, as they remain addicted to divination, they never reconcile with the peoples the reside near. As a primordial people, centaurs never had the ability to use anything beyond their original inheritance, in this case from the Cherubim.  
* Other "races" are not really people at all, they have varying levels of intelligence, but are all effectively the same as meeting different qualities of AI players, as if you were encountering cyborgs.  
   * trolls - created by the extreme use of magics on apes, the *most* intelligent trolls might be able to perform similarly to a human with mental retardation capable of living in a group home. 
   * gnomes - created by the extreme use of magics on clay figures, these beings have no long term memory at all. 
   * fairies - created by the extreme use of magics on insects, these beings appear humanoid, but still reproduce by laying eggs like insects.  Unlike gnomes, they have some ability to form long term memories, but only very limited ability to learn from these experiences; their actions are guided by instincts so strong as to make learning very very exceptional and difficult. 
   * house elves - created by the extreme use of magics on an unknown mammal (not a human), they are the most nearly human of all created beings.  They are capable of learning, loyalty and betrayal, they have memories equivalent to ours.  They closely mimic having true free will, just as some human scientists speculate the highest animals do.  House elves were created with an innate *need* for *altruistic work*.  An idle elf will get sick and die.  Even levels of self-interest that would be normal and healthily in a human is also sufficient to cause a fatal illness in a house elf. Thus while they need not be magically bound to servitude as is traditional, they can at best be in an underpaid servant's position.  When bound, and elf can "feed" on the bond, using its master's magic to amplify its own. 
* Harry Potter talks about two classes that require special mention, squibs and muggle born.  They are effectively inverse of each other. 
   * A true squib is the child who resulted from the 0.5% chance of becoming mundane.  Such a child is fully human, and no "muggle-born" will ever descend from such a child.
   * It is possible for a child receiving a partial inheritance from his or her parent(s) to have very low power.  On the scale of 1 to 10, in practice a child with a power level of 2 or below on all categories will be called a squib.  A child with 3 or below on all categories will not be invited to any magical school, but might be able to effectively use some magic.  A program like Kwick Spell might prey on such people.  
   * Because it is possible (16% chance) for the parents' abilities to recombine, these "squibs" who are actually extremely low powered nephilim, can eventually produce higher powered children.  These children will *generally* be low powered (a mix of 3s, 4s and 5s in the various categories).  However, sometimes (1% chance) the something bizarre increases the child's ability beyond expectations. 
   * This partially explains some of the bias against these "first generation" magical users.  Not only are they new to a xenophobic culture, but marrying them *generally* creates a risk of low powered children.  With this background, being of "pure" blood is basically ignoring the 19.5% chance of being under powered as compared to your parents. Illogical, but considering other human prejudices, not unreasonable. 
   * Per the the above, it is possible for a pure human to gain magic through the union with a fallen angel.  In practice, this has not happened in centuries, but magical society remembers adults suddenly having magic where none had been present before.  From this comes stories of magic being "stolen."  This is not true of course, no one lost the magic the witch gained from her unholy union, but most magic users do not believe in angels, much less fallen angels, and have a strong distrust for the Church.
