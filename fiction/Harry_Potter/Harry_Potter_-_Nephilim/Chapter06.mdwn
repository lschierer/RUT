This Chapter continues Year 5.  In this Chapter Harry takes a different route
home from school and takes refuge in a Catholic Church.  Given his invisibility,
this is probably weather related, though I may change that.  The FSSP priest
assigned to the parish *is able to see him,* at least within the Church, I am
undecided about outside it.  

FSSP has a parish in Reading, established around 2007 or so.[^20210604-2]  As
this is a fictional universe anyway, I am asserting a couple of historical
fictions: this parish is now in Little Whinging Surrey, and was established in
1989 as one of FSSP's first locations.  Since FSSP was created in
1988,[^20210604-3] this is more than a bit of a stretch, but it makes sense
given my [[AU Rules|fiction/Harry_Potter/Harry_Potter_-_Nephilim]] that it would
be an order dedicated to things traditional that would remember the (fictional)
nephilim.
