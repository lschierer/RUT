The Nephilim unknowingly locked in the underground refuge during [[The
Flood|The_Flood]] did not immediately become dwarfs.  Rather, this was a gradual
process as the few clans intermarried and their isolated lifestyle gradually
turned in on itself.  As a people, they became very very greedy, consumed, in
fact, with avarice.  They learned much of the use of their power to work metal
and gems in wondrous ways, such that when they *did* rediscover the surface,
they would quickly develop a well deserved reputation as craftsmen without peer.  

At some point in the distant past, not long after their re-introduction to the
surface, the dwarfish people split along clan lines, and some left their homes
and migrated north.  Dissatisfied with the inhospitable climate they found,
their descendants became determined to retake their ancestral lands.  To ensure
their victory, they had the idea of creating a subservient race.  They chose as
the base "material" the great apes of Africa, for while hard to obtain (due to
the distance from their new homes), these northern dwarfs reasoned that the
resulting size and strength of their servants would make for excellent berserkers.
Thus the trolls were created, but not without great cost.  The northern dwarfs
found themselves made hideous, misshapen without and within.  Those that saw
them no longer recognised them as dwarfs at all, but rather called them goblins.

Thus the goblin wars started.  Dwarfs and goblins would wage subterranean warfare
until at last the true dwarfs were wiped out.  In the process of this however,
two things would happen.  

First, the goblins lost control over the trolls, who now range free.  Lacking
immortal souls and true free will, the trolls never rose above the level of
wandering tribes.  They have only the most rudimentary of languages, and some
experts refuse to grant that tallish communication is in fact true language,
opining that "language" requires more than nouns and verbs (trolls lack all
concepts of adjectives and adverbs except a highly simplistic concept of
amount).  Only the most intelligent of trolls are capable of learning to wield a
weapon, even a club, without self injury, and only the truly exceptional can be
trained to follow simple directions and act as "security trolls."  

Secondly, some goblins and dwarfs had relations - war is never a pretty thing,
and these *were* once one people.  Magic does strange things, so some of these
children were viable and even fertile.  A few of them were sufficiently
"dwarfish" that though they are still called goblins today, they *look* rather
less hideous than Tolkien (for example) describes, and are capable of sufficient
civilisation that the nephilim of today no longer remember the dwarfs at all,
but rather ascribe to the goblins the full history of both peoples.
