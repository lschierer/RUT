[[!meta title="Harry Potter - Nephilim: Backstory - Giants"]]
[[!meta author="Luke Schierer"]]

For all that mythological accounts of giants go back beyond history, the reality
is that giants are the newest of the races descendant from the nephilim.  One
would think that the nephilim would learn something watching the mistakes of
others:
* the dwarfs given the hereditary curse of transformation into goblins for the
  creation of trolls.
* the nephil girl given the hereditary curse of transformation into veela for
  the creation of doxies and fairies.
* the siren given the hereditary curse of transformation into merrow for the
  creation of leprechauns.

Unfortunately, Nephilim seem particularly resistant to learning.  It is perhaps
for this reason that when one wealthy but indolent family took a small mammal
and used it to create the [[House Elves|potter-nephil-magic]], they were
punished in a particularly harsh way.  Many scholars speculate that the intent
of this punishment is to create an example that will finally create a lasting
impression that some things are _**not to be done**_.  

Church records show that the family was given, for lack of a better word,
gigantic forms.  Averaging twenty feet tall, with proportionately thick fingers,
the newly created giants found themselves unable to manipulate books (for either
education or entertainment) or tools of any kind.  Not only that, and worse
(from a nephil's perspective) they were stripped of all magic except that
necessary to keep these unnatural forms alive.  Lastly, their intellects were so
clouded that they are essentially incapable of rational discourse.  In their now
mentally crippled state, they quickly (and accidentally) freed their House Elf
servants.  Between their clumsy forms, clouded intellects, and quick tempers,
they are unable to form any sort of civilisation beyond the crude
hunter-gatherer tribe.  When neighbouring families attempted to render aid, they
found that the skin of this new race acts as a shield protecting them from all
external magic, so that the example they form of why creating humanoid life is
evil cannot be undone.
