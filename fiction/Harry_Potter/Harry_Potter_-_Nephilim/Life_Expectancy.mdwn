based on Ms. Felicitie C. Bell, Mr. Michael L. Miller.  "[Life Tables for the United States Social Security Area 1900-2100](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_studies/study120.pdf)" 2005-08. SSA Pub. No. 11-11536. 
I'm using 1900's US numbers essentially because 1) I do not have UK numbers 2)
1900's numbers seams to me a reasonable average between the effects of the magic
that nephil would use (cooling charms, preservation charms, medical charms and
potions), versus their tendency to ignore non-magical advances in science after
the statute of secrecy.
