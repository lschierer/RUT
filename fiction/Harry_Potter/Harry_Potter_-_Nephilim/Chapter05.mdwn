## Harry Potter - Nephilim
### Chapter 5

At first the changes were subtle.  In prior years, the teacher would frequently
notice something was off about that Potter child.  The oversized clothing, the
odd high pitched whisper of a voice, the way he flinched if anyone came too
close would all normally attract a conscientious educator's attention.  In that
respect, this year started *almost* the same way - during morning
attendance,[^20210528-1] the teacher frowned and gave him an odd look, the kind
that frequently meant a conversation after class, but then seamed to forget
about him even faster than his other teachers had.  She seamed never to notice
him sitting quietly the rest of the day.  

It in the phys ed classes that Harry first noticed that something was
significantly different.  Dudley disliked these classes, and frequently found
ways to be disruptive.  Harry realised that unlike last year, he did not have to
use his legilimency to redirect Dudley.  It was not that Dudley was behaving any
better, rather, he was simply more random in his selection of a target.  It took
rather longer for Harry to make the next realisation: in any activity where the
teacher worked down a checklist, timed swimming trials for example,[^20210810-1]
he would be called on.  But in anything requiring teams, the teacher would
somehow forget to assign him to *either* team unless he said something.  It was
very confusing.

For Harry, the overall results were not entirely positive.  On one hand, he
found the school day more pleasant, he was learning more, and dodging less.  On
the other, the teachers seemed to notice Dudley's behaviour more now that he was
targeting a wider range of students in class.  They started to send letters home
with him, and when Petunia binned them without action, started to call in the
evenings.  Vernon did not like his evening to be disturbed by an irate teacher
or parent complaining about Dudley; it was surely the Freak's fault - making
Dudley look bad somehow.  It was just as well that Harry could usually depend on
getting a good meal at school, because he was getting less and less at home as
Vernon took out his anger by locking him up more and more.  

While Dudley seemed to pick on the easiest target available during class, on
the way home from school it was a different story.  Something about heading home
inevitably reminded Dudley that he had not pounded on the Freak in a while.
This lead to Harry Hunting.

This chapter is essentially introducing a new phase to Harry's life.  Harry can
be seen only for a short time after he is heard *saying* something.  Due to his
experiences so far, and the way that they've shaped him, he is disinclined to
speak much, so he's become nearly invisible.  This will interact with the
tendency that adults, other than Mrs. Figg and the Dursleys, have to forget
about him that we have talked about over the last few chapters. This chapter
should cover perhaps as much as the first term of the school year. 


[^20210528-1]: being an American, I do not actually know much about British
    schools, and have done only the most cursory research into them. Please
    forgive any inaccuracies. 

[^20210810-1]: <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/239040/PRIMARY_national_curriculum_-_Physical_education.pdf> states that students should be taught to swim, and that performance should be compared, for each student, over time.  Timed laps seems like one way a school would implement these two directives.
