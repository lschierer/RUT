## Harry Potter - Nephilim
### Chapter 5

At first the changes were subtle.  In prior years, the teacher would frequently
notice something was off about that Potter child.  The oversized clothing, the
odd high pitched whisper of a voice, the way he flinched if anyone came too
close would all normally attract a conscientious educator's attention.  In that
respect, this year started *almost* the same way - during morning
attendance,[^20210528-1] the teacher frowned and gave him an odd look, the kind
that frequently meant a conversation after class, but then seamed to forget
about him even faster than his other teachers had.  She seamed never to notice
him sitting quietly the rest of the day.

This chapter is essentially introducing a new phase to Harry's life.  Harry can
be seen only for a short time after he is heard *saying* something.  Due to his
experiences so far, and the way that they've shaped him, he is disinclined to
speak much, so he's become nearly invisible.  This will interact with the
tendency that adults, other than Mrs. Figg and the Dursleys, have to forget
about him that we have talked about over the last few chapters. This chapter
should cover perhaps as much as the first term of the school year.

    schools, and have done only the most cursory research into them. Please
    forgive any inaccuracies.
