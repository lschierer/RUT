## Harry Potter - Nephilim
### Chapter 7


---

Harry is now in Year 6, his final year of Primary School.  He's entered RCIC,
which the FSSP priest has allowed him to do only because he recognises that the
Dursleys are abusive, but that something (or someone) magical is interfering
with any attempt to involve social services or the police.  As a result, he has
quietly waived the parental (guardian) consent requirements.  Harry is also
learning about the magical world, but from the Church's perspective.  The Church
never signed the [[International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy|Harry_Potter/Notes/Culture]] (ISWS),
but does mostly tacitly obey it and keep things quiet/secret.  As a result
though, the Church knows far more about the magical world than anyone magical
would suspect, in some cases more than they know about themselves.  

This chapter should cover through but not including Easter of Year 6.
