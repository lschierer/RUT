#### History of the Harry Potter World

* Romans pulled out of Britan around 410[^20200623-1].  While Hadrian's wall
  isn't technically the furthest north they ever went, it seems to be the
  furthest consistently controlled, and probably represents the northern bounds
  of Christianity. Note, that bit about Christianity is pure speculation on my
  part.

* While the historical reality of King Arthur is uncertain, he would necessarily
  exist in this timeline.  To the extent that King Arthur and Merlin are
  historical, they are somewherein the 500s.[^20200713-3]

* Augustine of Canterbury arrived in 597.[^20200623-2] He focused on Kent, so it
 probably didn't impact northern Scotland till much later. 

* Northumbria, the northern most of the English precursor kingdoms, converted in
  the 600s.[^20200623-3]

* "Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth
  century"[^20200623-4] The exact progress of Christianity in Scotland seems to
  be largely speculative, messy, and slow.

* The Norse raiders imposed paganism in the areas they controlled, starting
  sometime around 800 through apparently the 10th century.[^20200623-5]

* Hogwarts was founded "over a thousand years" before HP2.[^20200622-1] Given
  the above, we can safely say that by pretty much any date in the 800s or 900s
  Christianity was around. However, it seems safe to say that the Hogwarts
  founders would also have been recruiting students from pagan backgrounds as
  well. While the Christian students might have been very anti-magic, the pagan
  ones would more likely have seen magic as part of their religion. Be they
  druids, or norse, the pagan priest classes no doubt included as much magic as
  Mrs. Rowling inserts into the Egyption priest class.  While the Cannon text
  only hints at this, there is really no other good way to explain what Bill is
  doing in Egypt. There was no Statute of Secrecy afterall.

* 1066 Norman invasion.[^20200704-3]  Malfoy family established in
* England[^20200810-1]

* 12th century (1100s) "Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and
  eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer’, became corrupted in time to
  ‘Potter’."[^20200810-2]  His eldest son marries the oldest granddaughter of
  Ignotus Peverell.[^20200810-6]

* 1215 Magna Carta first signed.[^20200713-1]  Per the article on it, it is
  clear that Catholicism is either universal, or nearly so, by this point. If we
  are to use the barons' rebellions as the origins of the
  Wizengamot[^20200713-2], then wizarding culture has been fairly heavily
  influenced by Christianity by this point.  How influenced?  In other words,
  how much of the wizards' conversion is real and how much is for show?
  Reference the "Fat Friar"'s presence as a Hogwart's ghost. Even if they are
  not practicing Catholics, how much of the pagan culture have they actually
  lost? This is not a purely academic question; its answer will determine how
  much of the magic that multi-generational wizarding families practice is just
  wands, potions, and engraved runes and how much is ritual song, dance, chants,
  sacrafices, meals, and other elements of paganism.  It will also determine
  how, for lack of a better word, Victorian wizarding society can possibly
  become. 

* 1289 International Warlock Convention [^20200622-2]

* 1509 Henry VIII King of England[^20200704-1]

* 1532 Begining of Henry subverting the Church in England.[^20200704-2]

* 1544 at the latest Wizengamot active.[^20202623-7]

* 1618-1648 Witch hunting across Europe reaches its apex during the 30 years war.[^20200704-4]

* 1644-1647 Witch hunting in England peaks during the English Civil
  War.[^20200704-5]

* the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689.[^20200623-6]  In _[The
  Accidental Animagus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/89/The-Accidental-Animagus)_ fanfiction author White Squirrel speculates that not only did society take an abrubt shift, with the pure-blood mania becoming more prominent than it had ever been, but that the magical society probably started to rewrite its own history, erasing evidence of its dealings with non-magical society, and of its own mutations and shifts over time.  In England, the Potters argue for the Statue to protect the Muggles,[^20200810-3] the Malfoys argue against it (to continue exploiting the wealthy amoung whom Malfoys often marry).[^20200810-4]  Once it passes, the Malfoys pretend to have been in favor all along.[^20200810-5]

* 1707 The Ministry of Magic established.[^20200623-8]

* 1837 Queen Victoria crowned.

* 1881 Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore born.[^20200714-1]

* 1901 Queen Victoria died.
