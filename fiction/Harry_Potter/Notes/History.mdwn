#### History of the Harry Potter World

* Romans pulled out of Britan around 410[^20200623-1].  While Hadrian's wall
  isn't technically the furthest north they ever went, it seems to be the
  furthest consistently controlled, and probably represents the northern bounds
  of Christianity. Note, that bit about Christianity is pure speculation on my
  part.

* Augustine of Canterbury arrived in 597.[^20200623-2] He focused on Kent, so it
 probably didn't impact northern Scotland till much later. 

* Northumbria, the northern most of the English precursor kingdoms, converted in
  the 600s.[^20200623-3]

* "Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth
  century"[^20200623-4] The exact progress of Christianity in Scotland seems to
  be largely speculative, messy, and slow.

* The Norse raiders imposed paganism in the areas they controlled, starting
  sometime around 800 through apparently the 10th century.[^20200623-5]

* Hogwarts was founded "over a thousand years" before HP2.[^20200622-1] Given
  the above, we can safely say that by pretty much any date in the 800s or 900s
  Christianity was around. However, it seems safe to say that the Hogwarts
  founders would also have been recruiting students from pagan backgrounds as
  well. While the Christian students might have been very anti-magic, the pagan
  ones would more likely have seen magic as part of their religion. Be they
  druids, or norse, the pagan priest classes no doubt included as much magic as
  Mrs. Rowling inserts into the Egyption priest class.  While the Cannon text
  only hints at this, there is really no other good way to explain what Bill is
  doing in Egypt. There was no Statute of Secrecy afterall.

* 1289 International Warlock Convention [^20200622-2]

* Wizengamot active.[^20202623-7]

* the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689 [^20200623-6]

* 1707 The Ministry of Magic established.[^20200623-8]
