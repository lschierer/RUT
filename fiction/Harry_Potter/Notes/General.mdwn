#### timeline
* James Potter born 27 March 1960[^20190611-1] 
* thus James, Lilly and Sirius start Hogwarts in 1971. 
* thus they graduate in the 1977-1978 school year.  
* James and Lilly get married between June of 1978 and fall of 1979, a roughly
  18 month window of time for them to get married and for any job he has.
  Sources seem to indicate he may have lived off his inheritance. 
* Harry is born in July 1980. 
* "little to celebrate" for 11 years prior. [^20190610-1]
* Monday night Potters are attacked. 
* Tuesday Morning people are already talking about what happened to the Potters.
* "Tiny old man" with a "squeaky voice that made passersby stare" - probably
  Flitwick.

#### Greengrass family

Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^20200520-1].
This is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly
debated.  Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what
we do know about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as part
of cannon, something I tend not to do.

#### Professor McGonagall

I really want to like Professor McGonagall, but so much that happens at Hogwarts
is troubling that I am conflicted about her. _The Board_[^20190823-1] by
[Clell65619](https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net) shows a critical view of her that I am, despite myself, really drawn to.

#### The Wards around Privet Drive and The Trace


In the cannon Harry Potter universe, the wards were set to fail when Harry turns 17, becoming an adult.  This has lead some fanfiction authors to speculate that any event that causes Harry to be emancipated would also cause the wards to fail.  Per the books, the wards were stood up when Petunia took Harry into her home.[^20180709-2]  I have to deal with this in this story.  How exactly do the wards work, and what protection do they provide?  A related question is The Trace, which also terminates at 17.  I initially considered that the wards might not have activated, as this would both be a bit of ironic justice and make the story easier.  If the wards do not change when Harry gets married because they are not working right in the first place, I do not have to deal with the emancipation that also comes with the marriage.  However, I dislike contradicting the text when it comes to world mechanics more than I have to.  I mean, I do have to some - wizarding households function on magic, so the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the Trace either allows for supervised household charm or does not function at all in wizarding households, probably the latter.  The whole "do not use magic outside of school" thing is more for muggle born witches and wizards rather than any real restriction.  Returning to topic, another possibility is that turning 17 is a magical event - literally.  Because Harry never takes arithmancy in the books, we do not see much about magic numbers, but we know they exist.  Perhaps this particular prime number impacts the operation of the wards (and the Trace must be some form of detection ward I think) in some way.  If that is true, then Harry's emancipation is a legal event, not a magical one, and so would not affect either the Trace or the wards.

#### Occlumency

This is another topic on which the books themselves are either incredibly
incomplete, or utterly impossible.  The interview quoted at the [Harry Potter
fandom wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/) on occulumency[^20191119-1] makes
the situation worse, not better.  In the interview, she is asserting that
Professor Snape's description of occulumency is accurate - that it is the
practice of compartmentalizing and/or suppressing emotion and memories.  There
are two problems with this.  One, it isn't really practical.  In
_The Grass Is Always Greener_[^20191119-2], Daphne describes what this would be
like in practice:

> Keep your eyes closed and let your mind go still. You can't think of nothing
  for very long, therefore you must think of something. So I want you to find a
  memory, or really an image, of something that is very neutral, very same, very
  uniform, and preferably all encompassing. It can be an image of the sky, the
  water in the ocean if you've been there, a large table cloth that's a single
  color, or whatever you know and can easily pull up.[^20191119-3]

Harry later figures out what this would be like to hold all the time:

> Harry had been diligently practicing his clearing of the mind every spare
  moment he had. He was proud of himself for a small break through he had had
  yesterday. He had finally figured out how to find the dark blanket, as he
  thought of it now, and still remain "normal". The result was something like a
  thin black haze across his vision and slightly reduced hearing. Still, now he
  knew he could have something of a shield up and still know what was going on
  around him, unlike being blind and almost deaf the first time he had done it
  with Daphne.[^20191119-4]

In that story, Harry choses the "view" of a room without light - total darkness.
This works, but basically means both reduced sight and, because he's partially
focusing on something else, reduced awareness overall.  Are you really going to
duel like that, as Professor Snape suggests when fighting Harry in Chapter 28 of
_the Half-Blood Prince_[^20191119-5]? People really can't effectively multitask
that way.  You can concentrate on your cleared mind, or on what is happening
around you (to be able to react to stray curses for example) but not on both.  

Secondly though, it is not even really consistent.  Professor Snape is described
as a master at occulumency.  However, he is _constantly_ showing his anger,
hatred, and scorn.  It is not only the positive emotions that can be used
against you, anger can be used aginst you as well.  The man who cannot look past James Potter to
see Harry Potter cannot depend on compartmentalization to keep his mind in
control.  The man who totally loses it when, in that same chapter, Professor
Snape totally loses control just because Harry attempts to use his own
spell[^20191119-6] is a master at emotional control?  It does not make sense.  

Muggledad in _Partners_[^20191119-7] offers a viable alternative.

> What you will do for Occlumency is to cast a wordless, wandless, and most
  importantly, incantationless shield about your mind and thoughts. It is very
  difficult to do when one's mind is cluttered with the humdrum of day to day
  life, so the calmness and unity of thought that is a byproduct of the Magicus
  Intimus is a vital first step.[^20191119-8]

_At first_ you will find it next to impossible to cast a shield while thinking
about other things.  _At first_ it is thus necessary to clear your mind.  But
with practice, you can hold this shield while going about your normal life just
like you walk and chew gum.  You might, with practice, even be able to walk,
chew gum, and catch a baseball, but you will have trouble chewing gum and taking
a drink.  So too, you can, with practice, hold that shield and do other things,
but when Professor Snape is focusing on legilimency, which is closely related to occulumency, he is vulnerable to Harry reflecting the attack and breaking into his own mind.[^20191119-8]  He feels the need to remove certain memories then because he, effectively, cannot chew gum and drink at the same time.  He can do legilimency, or he can do occulumency, and he can even switch between them relatively fast, but not fast enough to feel confident about keeping all his most sensitive memories in his head.  This is an explanation that makes sense, without going all crazy supper powered about the benefits of occulumency.
