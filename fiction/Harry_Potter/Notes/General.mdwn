### Notes on the Harry Potter Universe

#### timeline
* James Potter born 27 March 1960[^20190611-1] 
* thus James, Lilly and Sirius start Hogwarts in 1971. 
* thus they graduate in the 1977-1978 school year.  
* James and Lilly get married between June of 1978 and fall of 1979, a roughly
  18 month window of time for them to get married and for any job he has.
  Sources seem to indicate he may have lived off his inheritance. 
* Harry is born in July 1980. 
* "little to celebrate" for 11 years prior. [^20190610-1]
* Monday night Potters are attacked. 
* Hagrid, not Sirius, arrives first and gets Harry out of the
  house.[^20200629-4]
* Tuesday Morning people are already talking about what happened to the Potters.
* "Tiny old man" with a "squeaky voice that made passersby stare" - probably
  Flitwick.
* Dumbledore arrives at "nearly midnight." Where has Harry been all day?

#### Greengrass family

Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^20200520-1].
This is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly
debated.  A word search on the American Kindle edition shows her name only in
relation to the Charms OWL practicals.  Interestingly Pansy, Millicent and a 
Sixth Year girl are members of the Inquisitorial Squad, but Daphne is not.  
Why did Umbridge not trust her?

Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what
we do know about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as part
of cannon, something I tend not to do.  Mrs. Rowling says Astoria went "through
a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^20200701-1]
The interesting thing about this paragraph is that it is nearly all inuendo and
comparison with few direct statements. It says _Daphne_ is a Slytherin, but
nothing of Astoria's sorting.  It says Astoria believed pureblood ideals, but
while Draco's upbringing talks specifically about being a Death Eater
upbringing, there is a curious lack of specificity about Astoria. I find it
curious that Narcissa and Lucius "had high hopes" based on her family's status
on the Sacred Twenty-Eight.  If her father had been a Death Eater along with
Lucius, surely they would have more than merely that to base their hopes on?

#### Professor McGonagall

I really want to like Professor McGonagall, but so much that happens at Hogwarts
is troubling that I am conflicted about her. _The Board_[^20190823-1] by
[Clell65619](https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net) shows a critical view of her that I am, despite myself, really drawn to. 

Her timeline is ambiguous.  She joined Hogwarts at a time when there was more
than one teacher in the Transfiguration Department, approximately 2 or 3 years
after her graduation.[^20200720-7]  She informs Umbridge that she will have been
at Hogwarts "Thirty-nine years this December,"[^20200720-8] sometime in the
begining of fifth year, or 1995. That puts her start date in 1956.

#### The Wards around Privet Drive and The Trace

First of all, I am not going to spend much time worrying about whether or not
"wards" are part of the cannon universe or not.  The books may never use the
word, but the concept certainly exists.  The books provide no consistent name
for area affect protection magics, particularly not long lasting ones.  I am
going to join most of fanfiction and call these magics wards.  The books use all
sorts of names, and in some places descriptions of effects without naming the
magic behind it at all (you cannot apparate in Hogwarts).  I need a word, and
"ward" works well.

In the cannon Harry Potter universe, the wards were set to fail when Harry turns 17, becoming an adult.  This has lead some fanfiction authors to speculate that any event that causes Harry to be emancipated would also cause the wards to fail.  Per the books, the wards were stood up when Petunia took Harry into her home.[^20180709-2]  I have to deal with this in this story.  How exactly do the wards work, and what protection do they provide?  A related question is The Trace, which also terminates at 17.  I initially considered that the wards might not have activated, as this would both be a bit of ironic justice and make the story easier.  If the wards do not change when Harry gets married because they are not working right in the first place, I do not have to deal with the emancipation that also comes with the marriage.  However, I dislike contradicting the text when it comes to world mechanics more than I have to.  I mean, I do have to some - wizarding households function on magic, so the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the Trace either allows for supervised household charm or does not function at all in wizarding households, probably the latter.  The whole "do not use magic outside of school" thing is more for muggle born witches and wizards rather than any real restriction.  Returning to topic, another possibility is that turning 17 is a magical event - literally.  Because Harry never takes arithmancy in the books, we do not see much about magic numbers, but we know they exist.  Perhaps this particular prime number impacts the operation of the wards (and the Trace must be some form of detection ward I think) in some way.  If that is true, then Harry's emancipation is a legal event, not a magical one, and so would not affect either the Trace or the wards.
