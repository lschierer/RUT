## Notes on the Harry Potter Universe

### Black family

Unlike the Longbottom family, we have at least one cannon reference for the blacks as a "noble" family.  We do not know if that means they were in fact part of the peerage or not though.  Assuming there is a "family vault" that is controlled by a "Lord Black" though is a significant part of a ton of fanfiction out there.  It also seems to be a reasonable supposition based on what the books do state.  Many such fanfiction works further speculate that the Malfoy family expects to inherit that control and that title.  If you take Mrs. Rowling's Black family tree[^20210122-26] as part of cannon, such speculation is baseless.  You have to be careful because she does not clearly distinguish the male and female children, and because she does not put the children in birth order on any given line, but if you work your way through it, once Phineas Nigellus inherited, then the his son Sirius II was heir.  Sirius Orion, Harry's Godfather, descends from that line.  Assume that a godson cannot inherit - reasonable.  Next in line would be Arcturus I, who had no male children, but decedents of Harfang Longbottom are unlisted, that might include Neville.  Secondly, since we know that Sirius Orion was not properly disinherited because he _does_ inherit Grimmauld Place, it is reasonable to suspect that Cedrella Black might not have been either, despite her marriage to Septimus Weasley.  If so, then the Weasleys would be in line after the Longbottoms (assuming it is a different and now extinct branch of the Longbottom family that descends from Harfang).  We _know_ that Arthur Weasley, minimally, lives to inherit, so there would be no need to go to the third son of Phineus Nigellus - Cygnus I, from whom Draco is descended.  Remember, even if girls cannot inherit, their sons can.   If the Black family is following an absolute male only primogeniture, then Draco would still be unable to inherit as he is in line via his mother, who would be disqualified by gender.  The dates for this line of speculation are in the [[History]] timeline.

### Greengrass family

Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^20200520-1].
This is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly
debated.  A word search on the American Kindle edition shows her name only in
relation to the Charms OWL practicals.  Interestingly Pansy, Millicent and a 
Sixth Year girl are members of the Inquisitorial Squad, but Daphne is not.  
Why did Umbridge not trust her?

Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what
we do know about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as part
of cannon, something I tend not to do.  Mrs. Rowling says Astoria went "through
a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^20200701-1]
The interesting thing about this paragraph is that it is nearly all innuendo and
comparison with few direct statements. It says _Daphne_ is a Slytherin, but
nothing of Astoria's sorting.  It says Astoria believed pureblood ideals, but
while Draco's upbringing talks specifically about being a Death Eater
upbringing, there is a curious lack of specificity about Astoria. I find it
curious that Narcissa and Lucius "had high hopes" based on her family's status
on the Sacred Twenty-Eight.  If her father had been a Death Eater along with
Lucius, surely they would have more than merely that to base their hopes on?

### Longbottom Family

Lots of fanfiction puts the Longbottom family into the nobility.  I see no
indication of Augusta Longbottom being called "Lady Longbottom" outside of
fanfiction.  We have few descriptions of her, but her fox fur is described as
"moth eaten," which means that if they are part of the nobility, they are
impoverished.
