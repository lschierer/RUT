[[!toc levels=3 startlevel=2]]

Any attempt to understand [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]], [[Lily|adults/Lily]], [[James|adults/James]], [[Snape|adults/Snape]], the
relationships (both positive and negative) between them, and yes, even to some
extent [[McGonagall]] and [[Dumbledore]] ends up pivoting on the events at the
end of the 1975-1976 school year when [[Lily|adults/Lily]], [[James|adults/James]] and their friends (or
enemies as the case may be) were in their fifth year. We do not know the exact
chronology, what follows is my best reconstruction. 

## What Happened

My first instinct is to quote it, the first scene is most of page 278 in
the American Kindle Edition, the second scene has key details from kindle
location 9426-9519 in the American Edition of the *fifth* book (it is skimmed
over in the seventh, though we are told Harry re-watches it), and the third
scene takes up a chunk of page 279 back in _Deathly Hallows_.  Overall there is
just way too much of Mrs. Rowling's copyrighted text for me to feel comfortable
even block quoting it.  So I will summarise what we know. 
from these two books. 

### Evidence from The Shrieking Shack[^20210921-5]
* “Severus was very interested in where I went every month,” 
* [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] says that [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] alone is responsible for telling [[Snape|adults/Snape]] to
  go into the tunnel, and how.
* Per [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]], [[James|adults/James]] found out only later what [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] had done. 
* Per [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]], [[Snape|adults/Snape]] believed that [[James|adults/James]] and [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] were in on
  [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]]' actions.
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] confirms that belief as he reveals himself from under the
  invisibility cloak.

### Snape in the Hospital Wing 

Immediately following the events in the Shrieking Shack:

> “Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,” he
> breathed. “You haven’t forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that
> he once tried to kill *me*?”[^20210921-6]

The above quote is almost trivial, it is hard to blame [[Snape|adults/Snape]] for disliking
someone who tried to kill him after all.  The reason I bring it up is that
[[Snape|adults/Snape]] of all people must know that things are not always as they seem - his
entire life since the prophesy has been subterfuge.  He of all people must
understand the value of forgiveness and second chances - if [[Dumbledore]] was
not willing to give [[Snape|adults/Snape]] a chance, then he would not be there to complain.
And yet, he is not willing to allow for either in the case of those who have
wronged him.

### First relevant memory from Snape[^20210921-7]

* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] and [[Snape|adults/Snape]] are an unknown amount older than when they were sorted.
  We *infer* that this is fifth year. 
* Mulciber has tried to do something to Mary Macdonald "the other day" that
  [[Lily|adults/Lily]] considers proof-positive that Mulciber is "creepy."  Whatever he
  tried to do involved [[Dark Magic|Magic]].  
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] dismisses [[Lily|adults/Lily]]'s concerns saying that Mulciber's actions are
  funny. 
* When dismissing her concerns does not work, [[Snape|adults/Snape]] tries to redirect the
  conversation to the failings of [[James|adults/James]] and company.  
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] immediately focuses in on [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]'s status as a werewolf. 
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] turns cold when responding.  My inference is that [[Lily|adults/Lily]] disagrees
  with [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s bias against werewolves.  I am unsure if [[Lily|adults/Lily]] is truly
  ignorant of [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]'s status, or if she is pretending to be. It probably
  does not matter which. 
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] blushes under [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s "intense" gaze.  More is going on in this
  conversation than the surface words.  I am not incredible at this people
  reading thing.  Is Lily reacting to [[Snape|adults/Snape]] being attracted to her, or is
  [[Lily|adults/Lily]] reacting to the fact that she *is* attracted to [[James|adults/James]] and
  [[Snape|adults/Snape]] has accurately called her on the fact?
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] defends [[James|adults/James]] and Co saying "They don't use Dark Magic."  
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] calls [[Snape|adults/Snape]] ungrateful, because [[James|adults/James]] saved [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s life.
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] claims that [[James|adults/James]] was saving himself, that saving [[Snape|adults/Snape]] was
  essentially a selfish act. 
* Once [[Lily|adults/Lily]] states that [[James|adults/James]] is "an arrogant toerag," [[Snape|adults/Snape]] stops
  listening to anything she says.  

### Snape's second relevant memory, Order of the Phoenix version[^20210921-8]

* It is the Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL written exam.
* [[James|adults/James]] and [[Snape|adults/Snape]] (minimally) *leave the exam with the exam question
  paper.*  
* [[James|adults/James]] and [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] are talking very openly about [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]'s status as a
  werewolf, yet [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] after himself saying "His name's Remus Lupin" as a
  joke answer to "signs that identify a werewolf" tells [[James|adults/James]] to keep his
  voice down two lines later.  
* They settle outside under a tree, and [[Snape|adults/Snape]] *just happens* to settle down
  within hearing distance of his worst enemies. 
* [[James|adults/James]] is showing off with a snitch, well aware that there are girls in the
  area (even if they are not watching, they might see him).  
* [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] is bored.
* [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] claims he does not need to consult a book to quiz [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]].
* [[James|adults/James]] spots [[Snape|adults/Snape]], who is about to leave the area. 
* "Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack"
* [[James|adults/James]] is faster. He uses two fairly harmless spells.  He's still watching
  to see the girls' reaction.  
* [[James|adults/James]] uses a spell to wash [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s mouth out for bad language.  This
  is undoubtedly fairly cruel. 
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] to the rescue.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] is very cold at first towards [[James|adults/James]]
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] fires off something that draws blood.
* [[James|adults/James]] reacts with a spell that leaves [[Snape|adults/Snape]] hanging upside down with
  his underwear on display. 
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]]'s face twitches.  I think perhaps she considers this fair retribution
  for a spell that draws blood. She's hiding that fact from [[James|adults/James]] though. 
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] insists that [[James|adults/James]] and [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] end the torment.
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] calls [[Lily|adults/Lily]] a Mudblood.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] turns cold towards [[Snape|adults/Snape]] and calls him "Snivellus" for the first
  time, knowing that will hurt him.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] says that [[James|adults/James]] is as bad as [[Snape|adults/Snape]]. Her reasoning is partly
  that he tries to make himself look cool, and partly that he hexes people just
  because he can.  
* [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] interprets [[Lily|adults/Lily]]'s comments as essentially boiling down to
  [[James|adults/James]] being arrogant.  
* [[James|adults/James]] returns to tormenting [[Snape|adults/Snape]] when [[Lily|adults/Lily]] storms off.

### Snape's Third Relevant Memory[^20210921-9]

* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] apologies.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] refuses to hear it. 
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] says he did not mean to call her Mudblood.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] calls him out for his friends who all want to be Death Eaters.  She
  further claims that [[Snape|adults/Snape]] wants to be one. 
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] opens his mouth to deny this, but then closes it without saying
  anything. 
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] again tries to protest he did not mean to call her names.
* [[Lily|adults/Lily]] is having none of it, because he calls other people by the same
  names.
* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] has no response. 

## What does this mean

### Looking at the events themselves

I do not doubt that [[James|adults/James]] was in fact fairly arrogant, and that
was a barrier to any friendship between himself and [[Lily|adults/Lily]].  That
being said, I do *not* think that [[Lily|adults/Lily]] disliked him as much as
it sounds.  I am not the best at reading people, but I think [[Harry]] is worse,
and, unfortunately, everything we know is filtered through his perceptions (or
in this case lack thereof).  [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is inordinately focused on
making sure that [[Lily|adults/Lily]] sees [[James|adults/James]] in a bad
light.  *Some* of that is because *[[Snape|adults/Snape]]* is aware that
[[James|adults/James]] is a rival for her affections.  

There are, however, only two real possibilities here.  

1. [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is irrationally jealous of the mere *possibility* that
   [[Lily|adults/Lily]] *might* like [[James|adults/James]] merely because he
   \([[James|adults/James]]\) is popular.  [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is so
   irrational about [[Lily|adults/Lily]] that he actually undermines his own
   position to reassure himself on this point. 
1. To bastardise an overused quote, [[Lily|adults/Lily]] doth protest too much.
   In other words, she *does* show signs of being attracted to
   [[James|adults/James]], and [[Snape|adults/Snape]], being both jealous and
   perceptive, picks up on these signs.  He does not know how to deal with the
   fact, and undermines his own position trying to undo something he sees going
   on. 

[[Snape|adults/Snape]] *is* ungrateful, though if he *truly* believes that
[[James|adults/James]] was motivated by selfishness, *then and only then* is
that attitude justified.  Assume [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]'s account is accurate -
[[James|adults/James]] neither knew about nor condoned [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]]'
extremely poor idea of a "joke."  [[James|adults/James]] then himself risked the
fully grown werewolf to save [[Snape|adults/Snape]].  There are a couple of
possibilities:

1. It has been suggested that [[Snape|adults/Snape]] had been speculating that
   [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] was a werewolf for some time prior to the incident.
   Not only that, but that [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] was aware that
   [[Snape|adults/Snape]] had so speculated.  If this is true,
   [[Snape|adults/Snape]] went down into that tunnel to investigate a suspected
   werewolf on the night of a full moon, then blames [[James|adults/James]] and
   [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] for the fact that he \([[Snape|adults/Snape]]\)
   found *precisely what he expected*.[^20210921-10]  If this is true, then
   [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is both a hypocrite and insanely stupid. 
1. [[Snape|adults/Snape]] had no clue what to expect.  He did, however, know
   that [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] hates him.  He broke school rules because
   [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]], who hates him, gave him a clue on how to get
   [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]]' friend in trouble.  Because that does not sound at
   all like a trap.  Whether or not you believe that [[James|adults/James]] was
   in on it, [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s behaviour is still insanely stupid.
   Honestly though, we have no reason other than [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s
   irrational hatred to doubt [[James|adults/James]] innocence.  

In either case, [[Snape|adults/Snape]] has been insanely stupid, and
[[James|adults/James]] has saved his life.  [[Snape|adults/Snape]] has been told
to keep silent, and is trying to find ways to ensure that the secret he has
promised to keep gets out.

We do not know what happened to Mary Macdonald, but [[Lily|adults/Lily]] insists
that it is [[Dark Magic|Magic]] and *Evil* (her emphasis).  Somehow that is
*funny* but [[James|adults/James]] actions are unforgivable.  Even if I
entirely agreed with [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s reading of events, I see only a
difference in target.  Since I *don't* agree with [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s
reading, I see that any offence against' [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is unforgivable,
but *anything* [[Snape|adults/Snape]] does is justifiable. 

### Looking at the memories

I have some questions about the memories, in both books.

#### The presentation

Unfortunately our most detailed account of these events comes from the memories
that [[Snape|adults/Snape]], a master [[Occlumens|The_Mind_Arts/Occlumency]].
We know that when Slughorn tried to modify a memory to give to [[Dumbledore]],
the result was painfully obvious in a pensieve.[^20210921-1]  What we do not
know is if it was obvious *because it was modified* or if it was obvious
*because the modification was crudely done.*[^20210921-2]  Thus we do not know
if it is possible that [[Snape|adults/Snape]] modified these memories or not; we
do not know how reliable a witness these memories represent.[^20210921-3] 

The second memory, the one with the most discrepancies (see below), has some
partial validation in that neither [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] nor
[[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] deny what happened, on the other hand, [[Harry]] only
describes what he saw, they did not see the memory themselves.  If
[[Snape|adults/Snape]] was smart enough to craft his lies on versions of the
truth, if he distorted true memories rather than than inventing things out of
whole cloth, [[Harry]] may not have included the details that would allow either
listener to notice the discrepancies.  

#### The content

There are a few details that raise red flags.  Unfortunately, some of them *may*
be a cultural thing, the difference between American schools and British ones.  

The first is, as I note above, that the students take the exam paper with them
when they leave the OWL exam.  Based on my experience of standardised exams,
this seems incredibly odd.  I know that all of the *[[Hogwarts]]* students take
the OWLS at the same time, but we also know that not everyone goes to
[[Hogwarts]].  As corrupt as that culture is, surely the Wizarding Examinations
Authority has had to deal with people buying copies of a test before.
Controlling access to the exact exam questions used should carry over to the
magical world as well. 

Second, as everyone is leaving the exam, we overhear [[James|adults/James]],
[[Lupin|adults/Lupin]], Pettigrew and [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] talking.  Keep in
mind two things, this is *[[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s* memory.  He was close enough
to at least subconsciously hear them. The book attempts to account for this by
saying that [[Harry]] has to strain to hear them, but, the passage describes a
"gang" of girls as having just left the boys' group, and then, when they start
picking on [[Snape|adults/Snape]], we see that a number of students are able to
quickly gather.  Why are they discussing [[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]'s status so
openly at all?  Why does *[[Lupin|adults/Lupin]]* joke about answering that
question in that way?  We see no indication of what volume most of the comments
were said at, but it is still very odd that so much was said before
[[Lupin|adults/Lupin]] became uncomfortable. 

Third, [[Snape|adults/Snape]] settles down in fairly close range to
[[James|adults/James]] and [[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] *at all.*  If this were
anything other than a necessary plot device in fiction, this right here would be
the single strongest indicator that the memories are fabricated.  As someone who
has had trouble with school yard bullies, you simply do *not* relax around them.
[[Snape|adults/Snape]] would have picked *anywhere* else on the grounds.  He
would have *stayed inside* rather than willingly putting himself at risk that
way.  

On a side note, in his work _[Toxic][]_, WitandAmbition makes very similar
points, but focuses more on [[Lily]] and [[Snape]] starting further back in time
to paint much the same picture.

    conscious recall, but "every detail stored in the
