## Harry Potter

See the [[Dursleys]] for some discussion on just how much and in what ways Harry
is abused.  That he is abused to at least some extent is pretty much undeniable.
The only real question is how does he survive it?  How much of his personality
is in fact reflective of, to be brutally honest, damage, how much is innate, how
much is resilliance, how much is residual from the first year when he was loved?
How much, being hard to explain with those answers, needing some sort of
hand-wavy answer of "the story requires it for his character to work"
essentially requires something along the lines of his mother's sacrafice not
just magically protected him from Tom, but also magically protected him from the
worst of the effects of his upbringing?

perhaps Harry is simply really really good at hiding his reactions.[^20200527-1]
