## Harry Potter

See the [[Dursleys]] for some discussion on just how much and in what ways Harry
is abused.  That he is abused to at least some extent is pretty much undeniable.
The only real question is how does he survive it?  How much of his personality
is in fact reflective of, to be brutally honest, damage, how much is innate, how
much is resilliance, how much is residual from the first year when he was loved?
How much, being hard to explain with those answers, needing some sort of
hand-wavy answer of "the story requires it for his character to work"
essentially requires something along the lines of his mother's sacrafice not
just magically protected him from Tom, but also magically protected him from the
worst of the effects of his upbringing?

explores as a one-shot from when Harry and Ginny are dating the idea that
perhaps Harry is simply really really good at hiding his reactions.[^20200527-1]

The sorting is increasingly a sore point for me.  A huge body of fanfiction
authors want to put Harry in Slytherin.  I know why - they are listening to the
Sorting Hat:

> “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a
> bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s
> interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?” 
> 
> Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, *Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.* 
> 
> “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all
> here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that no? Well, if you’re
> sure better be GRYFFINDOR!”[^20200602-1]

However, are cunning or ambition really defining traits for Harry?  He might
have liked his scar in the first chapters, but do not let the movies fool you,
that does not last long.  Even in that first Leaky Cauldron scene the books
describe a very different Harry, one who is overwhelmed, not pleased by his
fame.  Once at Hogwarts, Harry finds the attention annoying pretty much right
from the start, and will spend the next 7 years *hating* his fame.  This dislike
of attention will grow so strong that Harry will have trouble accepting praise
not only for being the Boy Who Lived (understandable, he does not remember doing
anything to earn that) but even for his skills on a broom, the fight with the
basilisk, and the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  He keeps switching between being
annoyed when he's babied (by Mrs. Weasley or other adults), and crediting
everything to luck precisely because he *does not* seak fame.  

This does not mesh well with the ambition that Slytherin is known for to me.
Indeed, Harry's loyalty to his friends, his willingness to forgive them with
very little in the way of a real apollogy, and readiness to risk everything for
them speaks more strongly of Hufflepuff than any of his actual actions do of
Slytherin.  

I think that Rowling tried too hard to force the parallel between Harry and
Riddle, playing up that Harry could have been in Slytherin but for his choices.
Perhaps the boy that Harry *could* have been - abused as he was in reality -
should have shown more Slytherin tendencies, but the actual Harry that we see in
the books would make a *really really poor* Slytherin, a fairly good Hufflepuff,
and an uncertain Ravenclaw (depending on how much he would have been willing to
use that "not a bad mind" mentioned above away from Ron's influence).
