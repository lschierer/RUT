## The Mind Arts

### Mind Palace

I have heard this one called a variety of things.  The basic idea is to
visualise something familiar and "hide" or "store" your memories "within" this
location or structure.  "Sorting" or "organising" your memories this way
supposedly makes it harder for an attacker to find them. 

The basic idea seems to be related to [Method of
loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) 

Personally I do not fully get this one as a defence.  The idea seems to be that
the attacker will be fooled by the visualisation technique, and will see the
mnemonic instead of the real memories.  I suspect it would come down to a mental
strength contest.  Can you hold onto your visualisation in place of actually
remembering things as the attacker hunts for memories?
