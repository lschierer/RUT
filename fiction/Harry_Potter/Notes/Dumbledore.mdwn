### Character Analysis

Musings of Apathy, in writing the original version of [Family Inseparable](https://musings-of-apathy.fanficauthors.net/Family_Inseparable/index/),
envisions Dumbledore as (my words) misguided, and perhaps ruthless,
but not evil.[^20180702-2] One of the things that really struck me as
I started to really think about the Harry Potter books (as opposed to
just enjoying them as stories), is just how valid some of the common
fanfiction criticisms of Dumbledore are.  In no particular order:

* Dumbledore does not seem to know about the horcruxes until he is
  presented with the diary.  He knew Riddle had survived the Halloween
  encounter with Harry, but apparently did nothing to investigate this.
* Harry's scar as a horcrux:
  * [Saving the Saviour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11833745/14/Saving-the-Saviour)
    talks about how Dumbledore didn't have Harry examined at all by a
    Healer after that fateful Halloween night.  Could the soul fragment
    Riddle left have been detected?  Could something have been done
    about it?  
  * See the discussion on Harry's scar in [[Horcruxes]] 
* More or less a follow up to the previous point, but further consider.
  Dumbledore states that he did not know that Harry would survive.
  Dumbledore _hoped_ that Harry would.  Dumbledore, by his own admission,
  knows that Harry will be willing to sacrifice himself.  The reason
  implied is that Dumbledore is well aware of Harry's heroic virtue.
  But when you consider how much Dumbledore hid from Harry, how calculated
  the final revelation is, I think there is more to it.  Dumbledore is
  not leaving anything to chance - I agree with fanfiction authors who
  think that Dumbledore has, in the choices he has made regarding Harry's
  upbringing, purposefully worked to shape Harry into someone who will
  make that choice.  This does not negate Harry's virtue; Dumbledore
  is building on Harry's nature, not creating it out of whole cloth.
  Honestly, if Dumbledore were as calculating about subjecting Harry
  to abuse as some authors would have him, then he took an incredibly
  reckless chance.  Dumbledore knows how similar Harry's situation is to
  Riddle's childhood.  I think that this plan is something that Dumbledore
  came to over time, not something he intended from the beginning.
* Dumbledore placed Mrs. Figg to watch Harry.  She knows she has to be
  unpleasant to him to retain access to him and thus fulfilled her mission.
  Surely this was reported to Dumbledore over the years.  He presumably
  did not believe her, possibly because she is a squib, and he has some
  of the pure-blood's unconscious prejudices against them.  Alternately,
  while he does believe her, he risks both Harry turning evil and Harry's
  health, because he views the odds that Harry will be killed by a Death
  Eater and/or a returned Riddle that probable.  There _must_ have been some
  middle ground.  Between Dumbledore's civil authority on the Wizengamot,
  and his experience with and control over magic, he could have dome
  _something_ to intervene in Harry's treatment.  
* Along the same lines, the following the quote from _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_:
  > You arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished
  > as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not
  > a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped
  > under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.

  and secondly the quote: 
  > You had suffered. I knew you would when I
  > left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning
  > you to ten dark and difficult years.

Against this collection of problems is Dumbledore's friendship with
Fawkes.  How intelligent are phoenixes?  Does the phoenix bond with its
partner (popular in fanfiction), or is it more of a friendship thing?
A phoenix in the HP world is a highly loyal creature.  Would this loyalty
persist if Dumbledore started to believe his own legend and allow power
to corrupt him? We do not, to my knowledge, have good answers to any of
these questions.  
> Fawkes slept soundly on his perch. Being willing to
sacrifice one boy's life and happiness was a horrible decision to make,
but not an outright evil one. Plus, the stories everyone believed about
phoenixes had been started by Dumbledore anyway. At the end of the day,
though highly magical, unicorns were just horses and phoenixes were
just birds.[^20191025-1]

Some authors of fanfiction have focused in on Dumbledore's talk of "the
greater good" in his relationship with Gellert Grindelwald.  To what
extent did Dumbledore actually turn away from this view of morality,
that so long as you act for the greater good, you can cause suffering
to individuals? Ms. Richa Venkatraman wrote a defence of Dumbledore on
MuggleNet[^20190301-1] in which she seems to express well the view that
Harry himself has in the book, that Dumbledore is ultimately a good, if
flawed, person.  I have trouble with this, it is way too close to "the
ends justify the means," and I am far from convinced that it differs
in any important detail.  Yes you should act to promote the greatest
good to the greatest number of people, but you may not do so using means
that encompass actual harm to individuals.  The ends (the greater good)
do not justify the means (cooperating with (in a moral sense) the abuse
Harry suffers).  I suspect however, that Ms. Venkatraman is right,
that Dumbledore suffers in his conscience from the pain he causes,
and he does _intend_ good.  For my purposes, Fawkes recognises this
good intent, but is not intelligent enough (a phoenix is an animal,
not a being) to understand the flaws in Dumbledore's execution.

I myself am convinced that Dumbledore, while not formally evil per-se,
strongly subscribes to a utilitarian world view that allows him to
passively allow suffering, so long as he does not _directly_ cause it,
and so long as he judges it necessary to obtain some end he deems worthy.
In short "the greater good" is a version of "the ends justify the
means" except that Dumbledore pays semantics with different levels of
cooperation with evil.[^20200624-1] Formally, Dumbledore's cooperation
is often Remote Mediate Material Cooperation, sometimes Proximate
Mediate Material Cooperation, and only occasionally Immediate Material
Cooperation. Dumbledore himself would view only Formal Cooperation wrong
(or "dark"), though he probably feels uneasy about Immediate Material
cooperation.

Notice that even with Remote Mediate Material Cooperation, Catholic
theology would require that Dumbledore exercise caution. Should he truly
be _unknowing_, then he is naturally blameless, but I suspect he's more
often being wilfully ignorant if not aware and actually negligent. He is,
to the extent that he does know of the evil results, or could and should
know if he exercised a normal level of prudence, required to assess
if his actions have a proportionately serious reason.  I suspect that
Dumbledore always does this, so he is not guilty where his cooperation
is Remote Mediate Material Cooperation.

However, with Harry, Dumbledore goes beyond this.  By sending him back
knowing his time there would be "dark" and "difficult,"[^20200624-2] I
believe he has gone beyond Remote Cooperation and is now doing something
that minimally "leads to the commission of the act" if not "is necessary
for the immoral act to occur."[^20200624-3] With either of these two
categories, Dumbledore is guilty to the extent he foresaw the evil, and
even more guilty to the extent he continued his course of action after
not just foreseeing the evil, but being aware that it was a reality.
The one thing I keep coming back to is echoed in at least one fanfiction
I have read:

> No, he could not admit he knew anything about the abuse. He could not
> admit that he had actually planned for it, to keep young Harry humble
> and meek; that he was now trying to duplicate it through Serverus'
> good offices.  
> 
> The world did not need another Voldemort: a powerful
> magical user working at the top of his skill level, with curiosity and
> drive and ambition. And with enough hatred to doom the entire world.
> 
> The world also did not need a Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black
> amid privilege and wealth and freedom. That wouldn't do.  
> 
> No, the world needed this Harry, shy, polite, an indifferent student, and utterly
> incurious, save for what he could learn about his parents.[^20200721-1]

Now in this particular fanfiction, Harry is acting somewhat out of
character.  The cannon Harry is *intensely* curious, but from Dumbledore's
perspective about the "right" things: Harry is curious about the Stone,
about the robbery attempt, ultimately about (although Harry does not
know it at first) Riddle.  The cannon Harry is even less academically
inclined than this fanfiction Harry is.  It is perhaps the closest
Dumbledore comes to being active.  There comes a point at which the
way he (Dumbledore) has been blind to the situation with Snape ceases
to be an act of omission, of merely neglecting to do (or even notice)
something, and makes one an active accomplice.  Dumbledore allowed
both the marauders and the Weasley twins what appears to have been
fairly free reign.  The marauders certainly and the Weasleys likely
crossed the line between humour and cruelty in their so called pranks.
In another place I might well speculate that Snape and Filch are our
primary source for this opinion and that neither is reliable.  For a
discussion on Dumbledore it does not really matter.  As Headmaster, he
was responsible to keep all students safe.  If the marauder's pranks were
justified by the injustice they fought, so much the worse for Dumbledore.
If the pranks were truly unjustified, the difference hardly helps his
(Dumbledore's) case.  Either way the students had to defend themselves
with no intervention from authority.  However, it is fairly clear that
James arrived at Hogwarts spoiled and at least somewhat of a brat.
Dumbledore could not afford for Harry to do the same.  Harry was being
groomed to be self sacrificing from the moment he entered Hogwarts.
But Dumbledore cannot act directly to effect this.  So what does he do?
He places Harry with family.  On the surface that's a legitimate and
nearly unimpeachable decision.  Never mind the abuse, Dumbledore will
be blind to it.  Never aware of how bad it was, and sorrowful that it
happened at all.  He puts Snape in a position of authority as Potions
teacher, but allows him to be a poor, biased, and cruel teacher.
Then he makes the situation worse by making Snape head of Slytherin.
Now Snape can justify his behaviour in terms of the bias his (Snape's)
house faces from everyone else in the school.  As head of house, Snape
has to show them that someone on the staff will support them right?
No matter what that means to the rest of the school, his house must be
his priority; surely you cannot argue about that.  And so Dumbledore
remains "blameless," at least in his own view.

Now sure, it isn't entirely fair to hold Dumbledore fully accountable to
Catholic theology when he isn't Catholic.  That isn't to say that Catholic
teachings aren't universally true and applicable, they are.  Rather, I
am allowing that Dumbledore may be granted some leniency because he may
honestly think that his judgements are both cogent and true. To the extent
that he is wrong about either the cogency or the ultimate validity of his
values and judgements, he can be judged to be sinful, but not mortally
sinful, and thus not evil. It is only where he is self deceptive, that
is he knows his arguments are either not cogent or not based on true
value propositions, that he can be held mortally accountable, and thus
potentially evil.  In this Dumbledore contrasts positively with Riddle,
who quite frankly doesn't care about either the cogency or the validity
of his decisions. Dumbledore is certainly _less evil_ though possibly
_more morally dangerous_ (in that he is more insidious) than Riddle.

Dumbledore might (almost certainly is) wrong about what the Greater
Good looks like. He is certainly wrong about what he can and cannot do
to achieve it. I do, however, think that it is actually some version
of good for the greatest number of people, and not merely for himself,
that guides his actions. The reader can decide if this is damning him
with faint praise, or giving him what little credit is due.

The quotes attributed to the Oracle of Delphi in _[The Greater
Will](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16234799)_ put it
well:[^20200720-1]

> “Power is always useless when it is just possessed, merely collected
like a bauble. The honors were meant for a protector. One must wonder
how you ended up with them.”[^20200720-1]

> “Mimicry may be the highest form of flattery,” she replied
pointedly, “but mockery is just an insult. Goodness is not served by
denying innocents their rightful protections in order to advance your
own agenda. Goodness is not served by denying justice to those who have
been wronged in order to purchase personal favors to be named at a later
date. Goodness is not served when knowledge is hidden and innovation
stifled in order to preserve the oppression which allows you to keep ahold
of all your worthless titles and stolen honors. You are not a good man,
Albus, warlock of Britannia.”[^20200720-1]

> “Warlock fits you better than you know,” she stated in echoing
tones. “The wizards of Britannia claimed it as a martial title for
honoring feats of battle, but it has a far older meaning to Mother
Magic, as a title for those who had forsaken their oaths of fidelity and
protection, just as you have done.” She sliced her hands through the
air as he opened his mouth to refute that accusation. “You will not
attempt to spin your inaction as anything but a betrayal. A false show
of humility is not a valid excuse for not using the authority granted
to you in order to serve the needs of the people who trusted you to act
in their best interests over your personal desires. If you truly did
not believe you could be trusted with the power imbued in the roles,
you should have passed them to another who could.”[^20200720-1]

Interestingly, Wikipedia confirms that "Warlock" does in fact imply
both male magic user and betrayer.[^20200720-2] This contrasts
interestingly with "witch,"[^20200720-3] "wizard"[^20200720-4] and
"sorcerer"[^20200720-5] that apparently have an etymology of simply being
a magic user.  Any work trying to work in the Harry Potter universe has
to go fictional at some point, since in true history magic is always
associated with the pagan, the satanic, or both.  So it is noteworthy
that the common titles they use, "witch" and "wizard," have no negative
connotation outside of theology and theologically influenced culture,
but that "warlock" would be used as a title when it does.  My guess is
that Mrs. Rowling though did _not_ do this on purpose.  It is merely
an interesting coincidence that the Wizengamot would chose "warlock"
as one of its leadership positions.

### Vision for Society

So far I have primarily focused on what did Dumbledore know when, what should he
have known when, and his use of power.  I have only touched on his actual goals.
If we agree with his goals, then his ineffectual leadership is a problem.  If we
disagree with his goals then his ability to persuade and delude people is a
problem.  There are few circumstances in which both are ever simultaneously a
problem.  Arguably the two wars precipitated by Riddle are, unfortunately, just
such an event.

We know very little about the actual authority of the Chief Warlock, the Supreme
Mugwump, or the Hogwarts Headmaster.  What is the relationship, in modern times,
between the Wizengamot and the Ministry of Magic?  Is the Chief Warlock like the
Speaker in the Muggle House of Commons?  If so the power is real, minimal, and
subtle.[^20200812-1] In a similar vein, what is the relationship between the
Headmaster (or mistress) and the Hogwarts Board of Governors?  What powers does
each have?  What discretion does each have?  Does each have distinct areas of
authority, or is it more like the relationship between the president of a
company and the board of directors?  I think even in the corporate world that
different companies have different answers to this question based on the way
they are chartered, so I cannot begin to guess how a school founded in the tenth
century might operate.  The ICW is even more mind boggling.

All this means that the pages I've devoted to trying to guess what Dumbledore
could or could not have accomplished is largely guessing.

We know that Dumbledore was friends with Gellert Grindelwald.[^20200812-2]  He
broke with Grindelwald, and the precise nature of and grounds for their break
are unknown and unclear.  However, it seems clear to me that it was his sister
that was the straw that broke the camel's back, not a philosophical difference.
Dumbledore could not accompany Grindelwald, and never would be able
to.[^20200812-3]  Ariana died sometime around 1898, based on Albus being born in
1881 and being 17 when she died.[^20200812-4]  Assuming Grindelwald's defeat
roughly coincides with the end of World War II in Europe, then Dumbledore
finally confronts him in May of 1945, some 47 years later.  That is a phenomenal
amount of time for Dumbledore to have allowed Grindelwald to go unchecked if
they actually disagreed.  I have not seen them, but apparently part of the reason
for the Fantastic Beasts prequel movies is to explain this
inaction.[^20200812-5] I will not give credence to this late addition to the
time line.  

More interesting is the question that is implicitly raised in _the Deathly
Hallows_ itself.  If Grindelwald has the "unbeatable" Elder Wand, how does
Dumbledore defeat him in a duel?  He is famous for the duel, so one would think
it would be well established as part of the historical record.  If so, then the
power of the Hallows is already broken, and he need not have the elaborate plot
with Snape to ensure that he (Dumbledore) dies undefeated.  The wand has already
been defeated.  This makes me think that there is something to Rita's claims
that there was in fact no duel.[^20200812-6]

Why lie about having duelled Grindelwald?  To paraphrase Dumbledore himself, I am
now leaving the few facts I have for the murky grounds of speculation.
Grindelwald had become notorious, the outcry against him was such that their
joint ideas for society were never going to gain ground under his leadership.
Even if Grindelwald won the war, his government had no popular support, and
would not stand.  Dumbledore could see that even if Grindelwald either could
not or would not.  That is a far cry from actually disagreeing.  

On the other hand Dumbledore himself was a halfblood.[^20200812-7]  I think
despite his mother's pretensions, his blood status was too well known for him to
get significant power in the pureblood dominated society of the early 1900s.  He
wouldn't become Headmaster until the 1960s or early 1970s, I suspect he had been
passed over at least once.  It was his defeat of Grindelwald that gave him the
statue to overcome his background and gain ground in the Wizengamot, to have
become Headmaster at all, to have become Supreme Mugwump.  

So if Dumbledore was going to advance the future that he and Grindelwald had
mapped out in their youth, or at least the version of it that Dumbledore wanted
(since they disagreed to some extent), the power of the old guard had to be
broken.  

But what would replace it?  Democracy is a poor choice from Dumbledore's
perspective.  He has never trusted people, but has grown up in an atmosphere of
secrets and lies.[^20200812-7]  He alone is intelligent enough to see what must
be done for the good of all.  Sacrifices must be made, and the muggleborn cannot
be trusted to realise that their families must be subjugated.  Dumbledore has
done home visits.  Sure he has seen situations like that of Riddle, but he has
also seen situations like the Grangers or the Creeveys.  Muggleborn cannot be
trusted to understand the dangers muggles pose.  Future girls like Ariana must
be safe. Magical blood, those of magical ability, are much more valuable to
society than some mere muggles.  Who knows what the muggleborn would vote for!
Why, they might want to give muggles rights! 

So what do we replace it with?  This is where fanfiction goes all over the
place.  Has Dumbledore been removing classes from the Hogwarts curriculum? Has
he used the ICW to ensure other schools do the same, or perhaps other longstanding agreements
among European schools?  Has he manipulated the student population more
directly?  Set up one student for failure, another for success?  A love potion
here, a compulsion spell there?  Has he embezzled funds?  Blocked attempts at
teaching muggleborns about the wizarding world, or the wizarding world about
muggle society?  

What about the Wizengamot?  Has he really done nothing with his seat?  Or has he
played off one faction against another, manipulated people behind the scenes?
Is is public face at all related to his private goals?
