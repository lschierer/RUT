Mrs. Rowling has left us with a mass of contradictions when it comes to
Gringotts.  Making sense of it is practically impossible, and yet necessary to
fill in many of the plot holes surrounding [[Harry]].  

How do vaults work?  What kinds of vaults are available assuming vaults differ
by more than just size and the nature of the protections surrounding them? What
other services does the institution offer?  What is the relationship between the
bank and the [[Goblins|beings/goblins]] as a whole?  

#### Speculations

* In "[Inheritance](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7989623/7)" of _[Tales From
  the Cutting Room Floor: Harry Potter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7989623)_,
  EdStargazer offers a view where vaults are, with the exception of trust
  vaults, just vaults, and thus *do* just differ in size and the nature of the
  protections on them.  Gringotts as a bank *does* offer other types of wealth
  management services, and outside of uninventoried household furnishings, the
  bulk of the Potter wealth is invested in such offerings.  However, at this
  time, it generates little more than is needed for [[Harry]] to live off of
  comfortably but not extravagantly.
