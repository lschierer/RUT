### Facts

### Analysis 

In many ways, this quote adequately says all there is to say:

> We got a very good look at his character in Book 3, when he didn’t tell anyone
> that Sirius was an animagus. In other words, he concealed crucial information
> about someone he thought was trying to kill Harry, and his reasoning was that
> he didn’t want to admit to Dumbledore that he’d made some questionable
> decisions more than a decade earlier. Seriously? Dumbledore being disappointed
> is a bigger concern than your best friend’s son’s life? That’s messed up. And
> Lupin just goes downhill from there, until he eventually abandons his pregnant
> wife. In some ways, I think it’s a good thing that he died. At least he went
> out a hero. If he’d lived, he probably would have been a deadbeat dad that
> left Tonks and Teddy when it turned out that married life was a bit tougher
> than he expected.[^20210519-12]
