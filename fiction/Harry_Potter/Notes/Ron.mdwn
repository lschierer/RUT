[[!meta title="Ron Weasley"]]

When you first read the [[Harry]] Potter books for the first time, you
cannot help but like Ron.  In retrospect, the fact that when [[Harry]] tells
Ron something of the Dursleys, "This seemed to cheer Ron up."[^20200728-2]
Still, the boy was eleven, he was embarrassed by his own (perceived) poverty,
that much is normal and understandable in anyone.  And if [[Ginny]] grew
up hearing the story of The-Boy-Who-Lived, then so too did Ron - they are
only a year apart in age.  So when [[Harry]] empathises with Ron instead of
rejecting him, Ron feels better.  Ron expected to ridicule, he got sympathy.
Feeling better, in this light, is probably fairly normal.  It is only sinister
foreshadowing because this is a book.

So really, for the first three books, Ron is pretty much the good guy.  Sure,
he probably ought to be more studious, but honestly, how many of us at that
age really cared about our school work as much as we ought?  Hogwarts has
appalling oversight for the students unless, like at least one of the movies,
you add in mandatory study halls that are not present in the books (but are
probably more representative of true British public school experience).

It is in fourth year that things start to turn.  First Ron decides that
[[Harry]] not only put his own name in, but then lied about it.  Lets be
honest here.  We know that [[Harry]] did not put his name in, but [[Harry]],
like Ron, *did* dream of the "eternal glory" aspect of winning the tournament.
Ron's jealousy and distrust is not appealing, and I would have trouble
forgiving it.  Still, we cannot help but applaud when [[Harry]] *does*
forgive Ron.  [[Harry]] has few friends, and when I was first reading the
books I was more relieved to see [[Harry]] get the support he needed, I was
not worried about the deeper implications of what this says about Ron.

The anger with which Ron reacts when [[Hermione]] goes to the Ball with Krum
probably ought to have disturbed me more.  I do not expect a fourteen year old
boy to be particularly clued in about girls.  Ron is now the equivalent of a
freshman in high school, if he went to a US school instead of a UK school.
Freshmen are just starting to get past standing awkwardly across the room
from each other, and just starting to group date.  So while Ron is perhaps
a little on the immature side of things, the Ball has pushed both Ron and
[[Harry]] far beyond their comfort zone.

It is not the lead up to Ball then that is concerning, it is the anger that
comes when he sees [[Hermione]] with Krum.  He gets into a screaming match
with her, insults her, then claims that it is *her* fault for upsetting
*him.* The older Ron gets, the more his habit of reacting to embarrassment
with anger is a concern.  Lashing out to hurt those close to you because
you cannot handle your own emotions … we will see this again in sixth year
when he dates Lavender.

Speaking of whom, come on, really?  Dating a girl just because you are
jealous of the girl you really like having kissed someone else two years
ago?  Especially right after she just asked you out?  This is not cool.
Ron is using Lavender, purposefully hurting Hermione, and in denial about
both behaviours.  The only excuse for [[Harry]] putting up with Ron is that
[[Harry]] is himself abused and does not really have any models on how to
handle relationships of any kind.

But really I probably would have forgiven Ron everything up until the
seventh book.  That is when I moved to actually disliking the character.

Ron's behaviour at the beginning of the summer when he accuses [[Harry]]
of messing with [[Ginny]] more or less makes sense.  If you are going to
break up with a girl, then do so.  No matter how little [[Harry]] wanted to
break up with [[Ginny]], doing so then kissing her, if he had initiated it,
would have been playing with her emotions.

But somehow Ron decides that [[Harry]] broke up with [[Ginny]] because he was
really secretly attracted to [[Hermione]].  Sure the locket horcrux played a
role here, and Ron is not solely to blame.  The idea however is ludicrous.
[[Harry]] and [[Hermione]] have had ample opportunity to get together if
they were going to do so.  There was no need for [[Harry]] to have ever
been secretive about his supposed feelings.  At this point Ron is still not
admitting that he wants a relationship with [[Hermione]], it is pathetically
obvious, but unspoken.  [[Harry]] sums it up well.

> “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and
  I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I
  thought you knew.”[^20200728-3]

Sure, it is a bit odd that two teenage boys living in a dorm have not talked
about girls at all.  It would have been better if this had not remained
unspoken for so long.  But again, [[Harry]] comes from a background of abuse
and neglect.  He does not know how to verbalise these things.  Add in the
fact that [[Harry]] has been attracted to *Ron's sister* since at least the
summer after fifth year, and perhaps it is not surprising that they have
not talked.  Harry knows that Ron does not want to hear about [[Ginny]]
that way, and [[Harry]] probably does not want to think about [[Hermione]]
that way.  In fact, [[Harry]] probably thinks, that Ron is respecting
[[Harry]]'s feelings the same way [[Harry]] is respecting Ron's.

So this rambling tangent aside, where does this leave us?  We have Ron who
cannot believe that [[Harry]] and [[Hermione]] are just waiting to stab him
in the back, that [[Harry]] is not just going to stab Ron in the back, but
that [[Harry]] is the kind of person who will *crush* [[Ginny]] that way.
Ron, instead of confronting the issue, reacts with passive aggressive anger,
uselessly sniping at everyone while offering nothing to help the situation
they are in.  Having promised to see the quest through, having laughed off
the talk of hardships, Ron then abandons them, because he is hungry and
jealous of a relationship that does not even exist.

I believe Ron's repentance is real, and sincere.  Ron is not an evil person.
He is however a very very immature one, with severe character flaws.  I think
this immaturity is actually the root of most of what goes on with Ron.  At
heart, Ron really cannot picture a world in which [[Harry]] does not want/value
the same things Ron does, in which [[Harry]] is not driven by the same things
Ron is.  Thus [[Harry]]'s entrance in the TriWizard Tournament is so hard for
Ron because [[Harry]] must want the attention just as much as Ron does.  Harry's
protests about disliking his fame are taken as face saving meaningless
protestations, because who wouldn't like being famous?  [[Harry]]'s money is
such an issue because Ron focuses on his own desires for money, but really
cannot picture [[Harry]]'s lack of support structure that gives [[Harry]] that
money.  Similarly [[Harry]] must be interested in [[Hermione]] *that way*
because Ron is interested in her *that way,* and [[Harry]] cannot *really* be
interested in [[Ginny]] *that way* because Ron cannot really picture his (Ron's)
sister *that way.*  

It is the same thing with the horcrux hunt.  Ron, who has never *really*
suffered hardship, blithely dismisses it when the idea is in the future.  When
it becomes their shared reality however, [[Harry]] perseveres - he has suffered
all his life, while Ron becomes grumpy and bitter, a child upset that things are
not easy, but unwilling to work to change them.  I think that, if anything, this
insight into Ron makes his return to the hunt a greater show of growth and
strength of character than it would be in a more mature Ron.  The Ron who
returns is one who is now ready to face true hardship, with far fewer self
delusions about his own capabilities.  His growth may have been forced on him,
but he has, at least in part, risen to the challenge. 

I would, if they were real people, worry about his and [[Hermione]]'s marriage.
It would be very very easy to bash Ron in any fanfiction, and very very hard
write a fanfiction in which he actually deserves the prefect's badge he gets, or
the happy ending of the cannon epilogue.  Despite my own positive words about
him as he returns to [[Harry]] and [[Hermione]] in the forest, I think the side
comment about confounding the driving examiner shows that Ron still has a ways
to go.
