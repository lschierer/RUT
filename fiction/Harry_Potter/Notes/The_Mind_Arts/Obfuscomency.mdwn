[[!meta title="The Mind Arts: Obfuscomency"]]
This hypothetical mental defense consists of carefully arranging true and false
memories in a spiral pattern within your mind,[^211013-1] rather than in a
[[Mind Palace|Mind_Palace]] type construct.  The idea is that the attacker will
in fact get in, but will be forced down a pre-selected and time-consuming path
through your memories.  You are essentially assuming that the attacker has
either limited time, limited patience, or both in which to attack you.
