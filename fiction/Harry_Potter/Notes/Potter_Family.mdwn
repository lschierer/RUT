This tree is speculative based on the available information.  Charlus Potter is
placed based on Dorea Potter's birthday, and Henry Potter's dates of service in
the Wizengamot.  It is unlikely that Henry's child's wife was born as Henry
retired from public service.  It is more likely that his term in the Wizengamot
came in recognition for sucess in some prior career and thus later in life,
after his child(ren) are/were born. Since that pushes the connection up a
generation, I'm inserting a missing couple between Henry's mom (whose last name
was Fleamont) and Charlus (who had to be young enough to marry Dorea).  Sure
marriages happen with mismatched ages, but I think most witches and wizards
marry right out of Hogwarts.  I have no real basis for that belief, the Weasley
children contradict it, but I think it fits the culture I am envisioning. 

It is worth noting that the family tree developed on the Harry Potter fandom
wiki disagrees with the placement for Charlus Potter.[^20210303-1]
