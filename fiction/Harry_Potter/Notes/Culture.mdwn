## Wizarding World Culture

Of all the many world building elements in the Harry Potter series, this is 
perhaps the most debated.  Mrs. Rowling has given us a very incomplete and at 
times contradictory look into the world that Harry re-encounters as he turns 
eleven.  Just how separate is the "Wizarding World" from that which those
without magic inhabit? How many of the differences are due to the school
environment that dominates the books?  How many real differences does a school
environment populated by adolescents suppress?  Fanfiction has explored any number
of paths by adding all sorts of details as different fans have needed different
elements to make their stories work. 

### Household Magic

While the books suggest that Molly has her children do their chores largely
without magic, I simply cannot see wealthy teen-aged girls going to social events
without magical assistance, be it charms for their hair, magical replacements
for make-up (either charms, potions, or both), charms for clothing (both for fit
and to make the appearance more â€¦ magical), so on.  Some of this may be built
into the fabric when it is purchased, but I am reminded of the descriptions of
elven women in _The Elvenbane_[^20210329-20].  In that series, the women use
their appearance and clothing to display their magical prowess, with the goal of
making themselves more attractive as brides.  Sure no one talks much of that in
Harry Potter, but I think it is only because it *is* largely a child's series,
with little attention paid to marriage or the finding of a spouse. The hints of
this are there.  Lily Evens' magical prowess is referenced over and over again,
even by Hagrid[^20210329-21] Neville comes from a good family, but is belittled
for a supposed lack of power.[^20210329-22] Ginny's power is also remarked
upon.[^20210329-23]

That aside, if Molly is going to teach Ginny to cook, is she really going to
teach her to do so entirely without magic?  Sure, Ginny can peel potatoes, or
chop vegetables, but we see Molly making some sort of cream sauce with her wand,
as well as lighting the stove.[^20210329-24] Even if you suppose both silent
casting like we see in book six, and a form of casting that does not depend on
precise wand movements, to both turn on a gas stove and light it with a single
poke? It seems more that Molly has a stove designed for wand-based operation.
If that is true, Ginny would have to use her wand, or at least *a* wand, to
learn to cook on it.  While some families might have house elves, I think that
the world described is sufficiently traditional that most mothers would be
teaching daughters to cook, and thus an exception must exist.

### First-Generation "Immigrants"

I wrote quite the rant on the way they deal with [[first-generation witches and
wizards|Immigration]].

### Blood Status

I wrote an entire page on [[class and blood|Class_and_Blood]].

### Government

We know that there is a Wizengamot acting as a High Court[^20210329-1], an
International Confederation of Wizards[^20210329-2], and a Ministry of
Magic.[^20210329-3] The relationship between these and the powers of each is
largely speculative, especially if you use only the seven original books as a
reference.  

#### Ministry of Magic

* The Minister for Magic is democratically elected.[^20210330-6]
* Like the British parlament, there is no fixed term.[^20210330-7]
* Elections at least once every seven years.[^20210330-8]

#### Wizengamot

* We know there are about 50 members at Harry's trial,[^20210329-4] when it sits
  in a "full criminal trial"[^20210329-6] or in other words, "the full
  court."[^20210329-7]
* We do not know if "the full court" is the same as "the full Wizengamot," it is
  possible that some subset is on a "Judicial Committee" or
  some-such.[^20210329-8]
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, Mr. Weasley is not allowed
  in.[^20210329-9]
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, Mr. Malfoy is not allowed
  in.[^20210329-10]
* It is strongly implied that the Malfoy family does in fact have a title from
  the norman conquest.[^20210330-2]
* We are told that a Potter "has twice sat on the Wizengamot"[^20210330-1]
* There exists a "British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot"[^20210329-11]
* We know that the Wizengamot has a Charter of Rights.[^20210329-5] This
  suggests, but does not prove, a legislative function. 
* Able to at least suggest that a Minister leave office.[^20210330-9]

### Clothing

Mrs. Rowling insists that wizards wear robes.[^20200723-4] The problem is that
she claims that this is because wizarding fashion is intentionally frozen in the
16th century.  This is a problem because while academics, clerics, and scholars
wore robes in the 16th century, male fashion varied considerably for those in
other occupations.  This is very much part of era of doublets and
hose.[^20200723-5] Sometimes guys wore "over-gowns" other decades they did not.
Sometimes the doublets were more or less "skirted."  Some decades codpieces were
in evidence.  For the Hogwarts uniform to be robe based is one thing, but
wizards seem to come from every strata of society.  It is highly unlikely that
they all view themselves as court scholars; surely some of them would have
preferred a more lordly self-image, others a more martial self-image.  The styles
of the century she cites allow for both.  The working classes and farming
families would have wanted something more practical as well, even if they did
use magic in place of manual labour as much as possible and even when somewhat
unreasonable.  Who seriously wears robes with little or nothing under them to do
such classic wizarding things like flying a broom or duelling? 

The real question then is how the girls dress.  Magic allows for greater gender
equality, and the society described in the books _mostly_ supports that, though
it hints that there may be some severe social limitations on married witches,
and what is "proper" versus what is "allowed."  Do the girls consistently wear
long dresses, or do they also adopt activity appropriate garb?  If only the
quidditch players adopt activity appropriate garments, that might well be why
girls playing quidditch is not "proper."

### Parchment and Quills

I think the use of parchment and quills is a an example of Wizarding culture
being deliberately antiquarian.  There may also be an element of exclusivity -
it takes practice to use a quill with any degree of skill that pureblood
children will have but that first generation children will utterly lack.  There
may also be a sense of exclusivity in a second sense, parchment is *expensive*
and the extensive use of parchment even stupid little notes and homework
assignments will help keep poor families away from magical knowledge.  If you
cannot afford parchment, your children cannot do as well at Hogwarts, and thus
cannot do as well in later life. This came to me when I was reading a fanfiction
that talked about not just Harry using a fountain pen, but that many pureblood
wives "secretly" did the same for their (extensive) correspondence.[^20200816-3]
For whatever reason, it occurred to me to look up the steel nibbed dip pens that
predated fountain pens, wondering when in non-magical (actual) history pens
started to replace the use of quills.  I was really quite surprised.  Apparently
pens go *way* back, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org) was very
Britain centric (which is actually fine for my purposes), but apparently our
earliest pen (a copper one) dates from around 410, just as the Romans were
pulling out of Britain.[^20200816-4] It does not come out and state it, but my
guess is that for a long time fine metal work was *really* expensive, so quills
remain the standard writing utensil until the mass production of steel pens in
1822.[^20200816-5]  Interestingly, according to the article, these type of pens
are still favoured over fountain pens for calligraphy and other artistic works
that require precision and varied thicknesses.[^20200816-6]  

From this I can draw a couple of conclusions.  Magical users would dislike
fountain pens, because they seem drawn to multi-coloured inks (which are more
difficult with fountain pens), and because arts like ancient runes would need
much the same precision that writing calligraphy does.  The dip pen on the other
hand, should show no marked difference from a quill for writing your runes.
Both would be substandard to a brush - there is a reason that Chinese and
Japanese languages are painted, not written when you look at the really fancy
stuff. The dip pen could further be _engraved_ with runes.  In the books you see
spell correcting quills, and others with anti-cheating charms.  I can see both
of these being done more reliably with runes.  You want a dicto-quill?  Again,
you can see how this can be reproduced.  

Moreover, magical users are clearly drawn to the aesthetic quality of a fancy
feather.  Fountain pens _can_ be artistic, but are generally fairly utilitarian.
Your dip pen on the other hand could be a work of art.  I did a quick Google
search on "steel nib feather" for example, and you can just imagine a wizard
using many of those. 

Paper and parchment is a bit more uncertain.  Paper is *really* old, perhaps as
far back as 300 B.C. in China.[^20200816-7]  However, it took a while for paper
to reach Europe, sometime around the 11th Century.[^20200816-8]  Paper was
originally viewed with disdain, unworthy for formal communication, or important
works[^20200816-9]; something that would definitely influence the magically
community.  However, it seems that by the 16th Century or so, paper had largely
replaced parchment, driven largely by the printing press.[^20200816-10] The
Wizarding world does seem to have a sufficient trade in books to stock at least
two book stores (one in Hogsmeade and one in Diagon Alley), and I am quite
confident that the books give us a view of the press that the Quibbler is
printed on.  This means that they do use paper books, and paper periodicals.

Any number of fanfiction works I've read have speculated that there might be a
magical reason for using parchment instead of paper.  Most of these have not
really made much sense given the above.  However one I came across recently
does.  

> Paper doesnâ€™t take magic terribly well: parchment is a single piece of
animal skin, a unitary object. Paper is laid fibre from multiple trees, a
composite object and as such tricky to get predictable results out of when you
enchant it. The more you know, et cetera.[^20200819-1]

The reference is to some of the fragmentary descriptions we have from
McGonagall's lectures on transfiguration.  You have to be able to visualise the
object that you are working your magic on.  In this light it is actually easier
to see why it might be troublesome to enchant paper.  It would be all too easy
to have a charm take hold on only a subset of the fibres involved, and thus
behave erratically across the document.  This makes a strong argument for using
parchment (or vellum) for documents that are *actually magical in nature* (like
contracts, tests charmed against cheating, official government or banking forms,
etc), but not for standard every day things (like homework, class notes, and
letters (unless you are including privacy charms)).  

You would then want writing utensils that work equally well on both, but while
I can't speak to how a fountain pen or ball point pen might work on parchment, a
quill or dip pen should both work equally well on any decent quality paper.
