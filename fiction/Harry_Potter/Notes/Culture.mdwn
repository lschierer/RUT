## Wizarding World Culture

Of all the many world building elements in the Harry Potter series, this is 
perhaps the most debated.  Mrs. Rowling has given us a very incomplete and at 
times contradictory look into the world that Harry re-encounters as he turns 
eleven.  Just how separate is the "Wizarding World" from that which those
without magic inhabit? How many of the differences are due to the school
environment that dominates the books?  How many real differences does a school
environment populated by adolescents suppress?  Fanfiction has explored any number
of paths by adding all sorts of details as different fans have needed different
elements to make their stories work. 

### Household Magic

While the books suggest that Molly has her children do their chores largely
without magic, I simply cannot see wealthy teen-aged girls going to social events
without magical assistance, be it charms for their hair, magical replacements
for make-up (either charms, potions, or both), charms for clothing (both for fit
and to make the appearance more â€¦ magical), so on.  Some of this may be built
into the fabric when it is purchased, but I am reminded of the descriptions of
elven women in _The Elvenbane_[^20210329-20].  In that series, the women use
their appearance and clothing to display their magical prowess, with the goal of
making themselves more attractive as brides.  Sure no one talks much of that in
Harry Potter, but I think it is only because it *is* largely a child's series,
with little attention paid to marriage or the finding of a spouse. The hints of
this are there.  Lily Evens' magical prowess is referenced over and over again,
even by Hagrid[^20210329-21] Neville comes from a good family, but is belittled
for a supposed lack of power.[^20210329-22] Ginny's power is also remarked
upon.[^20210329-23]

That aside, if Molly is going to teach Ginny to cook, is she really going to
teach her to do so entirely without magic?  Sure, Ginny can peel potatoes, or
chop vegetables, but we see Molly making some sort of cream sauce with her wand,
as well as lighting the stove.[^20210329-24] Even if you suppose both silent
casting like we see in book six, and a form of casting that does not depend on
precise wand movements, to both turn on a gas stove and light it with a single
poke? It seems more that Molly has a stove designed for wand-based operation.
If that is true, Ginny would have to use her wand, or at least *a* wand, to
learn to cook on it.  While some families might have house elves, I think that
the world described is sufficiently traditional that most mothers would be
teaching daughters to cook, and thus an exception must exist.

### First-Generation "Immigrants"

I wrote quite the rant on the way they deal with [[first-generation witches and
wizards|Immigration]].

### Blood Status

I wrote an entire page on [[class and blood|Class_and_Blood]]. i

Beyond those notes, I think it really interesting when Mrs. Rowling states that
a Malfoy ancestor argued against the ISWS, was active in "high-born Muggle
circles, and that much of the family wealth comes from the non-magical
world.[^20210420-12]  This provides an additional potential motivation for the
dislike of the first generation "immigrants" and concordant emphasis on blood
status, the Malfoys, and families like them, may well want the ISWS to
fail.[^20210420-13] They want the ISWS to fail not because they like
non-magicals, but because they dislike the restrictions on making money off of
the non-magicals. They may have successfully transitioned and found new sources
of wealth, but interacting with the muggle economy will always be, in a sense,
free money to those with the most ambition and the fewest moral scruples, those
willing to "use any means to achieve their ends."[^20210420-14]

### Government

We know that there is a Wizengamot acting as a High Court[^20210329-1], an
International Confederation of Wizards[^20210329-2], and a Ministry of
Magic.[^20210329-3] The relationship between these and the powers of each is
largely speculative, especially if you use only the seven original books as a
reference.

#### Separation from the Non-Magical World

We do not know precisely how or when the British magical society began to
separate from the non-magical world.  While the [International Statute of
Wizarding Secrecy][ISWS-1] is fairly precisely dated, the government that
ratified it on behalf of the British people is not. The popular theory is that,
for one reason or another, the ruling class among the wizards (which may or may
not have been a democratically elected body and thus all of them) convinced the
Crown to sign a treaty granting them some level of autonomy in exchange for
fealty and non-interference.  Stories like _Not Normal_[^20210406-47], _A
Military Man_[^20210406-48], and _Mutant Storm_[^20210406-49] all fall into this 
category, though there are others.  Most seem to call this treaty "The Treaty of
Kent" though there seams to be no true basis for this name.  While most authors
have settled on that as a name, there is no similar consensus on a date for this
inferred treaty.  The one that makes the most sense to me is that from _Not
Normal_, that it came out of the unrest from the War of the Roses.[^20210406-50]

If you go with this theory, while the two governments might have been split at
this time time, it was not in fact illegal for wizards to live among or do
business with non-wizards by virtue of this treaty, and would not be until the
ISWS came in the late 1600s.  However, with the advent of the ISWS, many things
that some wizards, like the Malfoys, had been doing for years, suddenly became
illegal.  This prompted the British wizards to revisit their system of
government and revamp it into the more centralised, more organised, and
(theoretically) more effective Ministry of Magic.  

This theory fits the available cannon sources.  If the two societies had not
*already* been largely split, then implementing the ISWS would not have been
practicable.  If the two societies had been already *effectively* split, then
the ISWS would not have been necessary.  British people being who and what they
are, and the ISWS being a "foreign" concept (IE not originated by them), they
would not have gone for it unless it solved a local need.  While there *was* an
up swing in witch hunts in the mid 1600s, it was never a particularly wide
spread or particularly effective practice in Britain.[^20210406-51] 

On the other hand, suppose there were *already* two societies, even if some
members crossed over more than the ISWS would permit.  Further suppose, per the
Treaty of Kent (or whatever name) theory, there was *already* in place
mechanisms for dealing with land ownership, taxes, law enforcement, and
citizenship across the two societies.  For all its flaws, _Not Normal_ does a
fairly good job of world building a history of the separation for
example.[^20210406-52] In that case, it would be a case of making those
properties secret, and the offices in charge of keeping them separate equally
so.  That is much more obtainable than implementing all of that in a vacuum to
solve a threat that largely does not exist, is already in decline to the extent
it does exist, and requires admitting that those who do not have magic are a
threat to (and thus not fully inferior to) those who do.

### Clothing

Mrs. Rowling insists that wizards wear robes.[^20200723-4] The problem is that
she claims that this is because Wizarding fashion is intentionally frozen in the
17th century.  This is a problem because while academics, clerics, and scholars
wore robes in the 17th century, male fashion varied considerably for those in
other occupations.  This is very much part of era of doublets and
hose.[^20200723-5] Sometimes guys wore "over-gowns" other decades they did not.
Sometimes the doublets were more or less "skirted."  Some decades codpieces were
in evidence.  For the Hogwarts uniform to be robe based is one thing, but
wizards seem to come from every strata of society.  It is highly unlikely that
they all view themselves as court scholars; surely some of them would have
preferred a more lordly self-image, others a more martial self-image.  The styles
of the century she cites allow for both.  She says that "Day to day, however,
even those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing, which is
undeniably practical compared with robes."[^20210420-11] This makes sense, the
working classes and farming families would have wanted something more practical,
even if they did use magic in place of manual labour as much as possible and
even when somewhat unreasonable.  Still, who seriously wears robes with little
or nothing under them to do such classic Wizarding things like flying a broom
(Quidditch robesâ€½) or duelling?

The real question then is how the girls dress.  Magic allows for greater gender
equality, and the society described in the books _mostly_ supports that, though
it hints that there may be some severe social limitations on married witches,
and what is "proper" versus what is "allowed."  Do the girls consistently wear
long dresses, or do they also adopt activity appropriate garb?  If only the
Quidditch players adopt activity appropriate garments, that might well be why
girls playing Quidditch is not "proper."

### Education and Research

Oxford was founded between 1096 and 1167, the University of Paris between 1160
and 1250, the University of Cambridge in 1209.[^20210420-3] The magical culture
would no doubt remember the Museion in Alexandria that was founded between 367
BC and 246 BC,[^20210420-4] and ran until the third century AD,[^20210420-5]
even assuming they did not use magic to hide part of it from the non-magical
world and survive the destruction of the rest.  The culture would similarly be
aware of the Imperial University of Constantinople, running from 425 to sometime
in the 15th century.[^20210420-6] Wikipedia also shows centres of learning in
the right time frame to influence the cultures that would have met in the ICW to
debate the statue of secrecy in India and China.[^20210420-7]

This is compared to the magical world, that seems to have no institutes of
higher learning, education ends between age 17 and 18 depending on country.
Despite a world-wide population and a culture that values the long established
and traditional, there are only *eleven* prestigious schools
*worldwide.*[^20210420-8]  She attributes this to a combination of wizarding
wars and non-magical persecution,[^20210420-9] but I think more is necessary to
explain this.  I personally like the explanation given in RoseLilian's work _[The
difference a good solicitor makes][tdgsm-1]_.  

> Another issue is less reasonable but still relevant - wealth. The magical
> world is smaller than the muggle one, and our wealth is not in gems or metal,
> but in enchanted objects and hoarded knowledge. Muggleborns, who do not have
> such wealth passed down to them from their ancestors, have long used the money
> they brought in from the muggle world to buy knowledge and objects and then
> either shared it, making it nearly worthless in an economic sense or had it
> destroyed due to it being dangerous.[^20210420-10]

She describes this view as being a Slytherin one, not necessarily one held by
all, or even most, of the wizarding world.  Elsewhere I speculate that the
wizarding culture radically changed with the ISWS, and that isolationism and the
ideas of blood status started to gain a prominence that they had not previously
held.  Even assuming that is true, wizards were *already* showing a marked
difference from their non-magical neighbours in the realm of education and
research.  As I highlight above, the non-magical world was centralising
knowledge and pushing scholarship.  The lack of university course work, the idea
that your education is *complete* at age 17, shows a radically different view in
the magical world.  Thus I believe that while this view may not be universal,
and that Ravenclaws in particular may dislike the view, that it is a common one.  

This view would have the happy accident of explaining why in the cannon books it
would not occur to the Weasleys to step in and ensure that Harry and Hermione
know and understand more about the world and culture they are stepping into,
leaving so many holes in our view and understanding of that culture.  A culture
of knowledge hoarding and secrecy would mean that even well meaning people like
the Weasleys would have an unconscious taboo surrounding actually teaching those
outside the family anything not taught at school.

### Parchment and Quills

I think the use of parchment and quills is a an example of Wizarding culture
being deliberately antiquarian.  There may also be an element of exclusivity -
it takes practice to use a quill with any degree of skill that pureblood
children will have but that first generation children will utterly lack.  There
may also be a sense of exclusivity in a second sense, parchment is *expensive*
and the extensive use of parchment even stupid little notes and homework
assignments will help keep poor families away from magical knowledge.  If you
cannot afford parchment, your children cannot do as well at Hogwarts, and thus
cannot do as well in later life. This came to me when I was reading a fanfiction
that talked about not just Harry using a fountain pen, but that many pureblood
wives "secretly" did the same for their (extensive) correspondence.[^20200816-3]
For whatever reason, it occurred to me to look up the steel nibbed dip pens that
predated fountain pens, wondering when in non-magical (actual) history pens
started to replace the use of quills.  I was really quite surprised.  Apparently
pens go *way* back, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org) was very
Britain centric (which is actually fine for my purposes), but apparently our
earliest pen (a copper one) dates from around 410, just as the Romans were
pulling out of Britain.[^20200816-4] It does not come out and state it, but my
guess is that for a long time fine metal work was *really* expensive, so quills
remain the standard writing utensil until the mass production of steel pens in
1822.[^20200816-5]  Interestingly, according to the article, these type of pens
are still favoured over fountain pens for calligraphy and other artistic works
that require precision and varied thicknesses.[^20200816-6]  

From this I can draw a couple of conclusions.  Magical users would dislike
fountain pens, because they seem drawn to multi-coloured inks (which are more
difficult with fountain pens), and because arts like ancient runes would need
much the same precision that writing calligraphy does.  The dip pen on the other
hand, should show no marked difference from a quill for writing your runes.
Both would be substandard to a brush - there is a reason that Chinese and
Japanese languages are painted, not written when you look at the really fancy
stuff. The dip pen could further be _engraved_ with runes.  In the books you see
spell correcting quills, and others with anti-cheating charms.  I can see both
of these being done more reliably with runes.  You want a dicto-quill?  Again,
you can see how this can be reproduced.  

Moreover, magical users are clearly drawn to the aesthetic quality of a fancy
feather.  Fountain pens _can_ be artistic, but are generally fairly utilitarian.
Your dip pen on the other hand could be a work of art.  I did a quick Google
search on "steel nib feather" for example, and you can just imagine a wizard
using many of those. 

Paper and parchment is a bit more uncertain.  Paper is *really* old, perhaps as
far back as 300 B.C. in China.[^20200816-7]  However, it took a while for paper
to reach Europe, sometime around the 11th Century.[^20200816-8]  Paper was
originally viewed with disdain, unworthy for formal communication, or important
works[^20200816-9]; something that would definitely influence the magically
community.  However, it seems that by the 16th Century or so, paper had largely
replaced parchment, driven largely by the printing press.[^20200816-10] The
Wizarding world does seem to have a sufficient trade in books to stock at least
two book stores (one in Hogsmeade and one in Diagon Alley), and I am quite
confident that the books give us a view of the press that the Quibbler is
printed on.  This means that they do use paper books, and paper periodicals.

Any number of fanfiction works I've read have speculated that there might be a
magical reason for using parchment instead of paper.  Most of these have not
really made much sense given the above.  However one I came across recently
does.  

> Paper doesnâ€™t take magic terribly well: parchment is a single piece of
animal skin, a unitary object. Paper is laid fibre from multiple trees, a
composite object and as such tricky to get predictable results out of when you
enchant it. The more you know, et cetera.[^20200819-1]

The reference is to some of the fragmentary descriptions we have from
McGonagall's lectures on transfiguration.  You have to be able to visualise the
object that you are working your magic on.  In this light it is actually easier
to see why it might be troublesome to enchant paper.  It would be all too easy
to have a charm take hold on only a subset of the fibres involved, and thus
behave erratically across the document.  This makes a strong argument for using
parchment (or vellum) for documents that are *actually magical in nature* (like
contracts, tests charmed against cheating, official government or banking forms,
etc), but not for standard every day things (like homework, class notes, and
letters (unless you are including privacy charms)).  

You would then want writing utensils that work equally well on both, but while
I can't speak to how a fountain pen or ball point pen might work on parchment, a
quill or dip pen should both work equally well on any decent quality paper.
