One of the recurring issues that I read about is the exchange rate between
galleons and non-magical currencies.  It seems that many people dislike the five
pounds to the galleon answer that we were given in 2001.[^20210617-1]  It is
hard for me to say definitively how realistic that conversion rate is or is not,
however:

* I find that 
  > 1 Gram Gold Bar Size & Product Details
    * Purity: .9999 fine gold minimum (24 karat).
    * Gold Weight: 1 gram, or 0.0322 troy ounces.
    * Approx. width of the package: 2-1/8 inches.
    * Approx. length of the package: 3-3/8 inches.
    * Approx. thickness of the package: 3/16 of an inch.[^20210617-2]

That seems rather large for a coin, so it allows for a reasonable amount of gold
per galleon. We next need to know the price of gold per gram, over time.
[BullionByPost][BBP1] provides a [chart][BBP2] on that, which we will assume is
reasonably accurate.  Per that chart, in August of 1991, gold was approx
Â£6.77/gram.[^20210617-3] So as long as a galleon is not a whole gram, if it were
say half a gram, five pounds per galleon might actually be Gringotts making a
profit on the conversion. 

That being said, it is important to note that Mrs. Rowling said the exchange
rate varies.[^20210617-4] Gold is _**much**_ more expensive per gram now, so we
would be looking at exchange rates of something more like 40:1 now, if not
higher.[^20210617-5]

So given that the galleon exchange rate seams reasonable, I am going to assume
that sickles and knuts are either equally reasonable, or that the metals
involved are debased to become reasonable.
