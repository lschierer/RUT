One of the recurring issues that I read about is the exchange rate between
galleons and non-magical currencies.  It seems that many people dislike the five
pounds to the galleon answer that we were given in 2001.[^20210617-1]  It is
hard for me to say definitively how realistic that conversion rate is or is not,
however, I  find that 
> * Width: 8mm (0.32 inches)
> * Length: 15mm (0.59 inches)
> * Depth/Thickness: 0.4mm (0.02 inches)[^20210617-6]

That might be slightly small for a coin, but if you assume a galleon is not
pure, it allows for a reasonable amount of gold per galleon. We next need to
know the price of gold per gram, over time.  [BullionByPost][BBP1] provides a
[chart][BBP2] on that, which we will assume is reasonably accurate.  Per that
chart, in August of 1991, gold was approx Â£6.77/gram.[^20210617-3] 

It is important to note that Mrs. Rowling said the exchange rate
varies.[^20210617-4] Gold is _**much**_ more expensive per gram now, so we
would be looking at exchange rates of something more like 40:1 now, if not
higher.[^20210617-5]  It is also important to know that her math is notoriously
poor, and that 5:1 was an estimate.  

So given that the galleon exchange rate seems more or less reasonable, I am
going to assume that sickles and knuts are either equally reasonable, or that
the metals involved are debased to become reasonable. 

So in summary, galleons are not pure gold, and 5:1 was a slightly low estimate
of what the exchange rate was when the series started.  As the rate varied
considerably over the course of Harry's seven years, one would expect anything
under 10:1 to be reasonable, but that it would probably go up and down a fair
amount.
