#### Weasley Ages

The ages for Bill and Charlie are hard.  
* Harry is born in 1980
* Per PotterMore[^20190327-1] [[[Ron]] was born on 1980-03-01. 
* Per PotterMore[^20190327-2] Fred and George were born on 1978-04-01.
* PotterMore does not list Percy's birth year (his birthday is August 22)[^20190327-3]. I'm going to assume a Hogwarts cutoff of September 1.  Percy is in 5th year when Harry is in 1st, so Percy is 4 years older - 1976.  
* Charlie and Bill are harder.  I'm going with the <https://www.hp-lexicon.org> date for them.  
  * Per the lexicon[^20190327-4], Charlie has a birthday of December 12 1972.
  * Per the lexicon[^20190327-5], Bill has a birthday of November 29, 1970.

One of the interesting things about this is that it means Charlie's seventh year
is the year before Harry and Ron start. The books go on and on about how Charlie
"could have played for England"[^20200629-2], and then in Harry's third year
Wood says that "Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now."[^20200629-3] Per the
chart above, this means that Gryffindor last won (assuming Wood is counting
the current year) since 1987, Charlie's fourth year. From this I'm going to
conclude that the great Quidditch player, never won a season as captain of the
team.  

Now we know from Harry's own Quidditch career that a winning seeker can have a
losing season, but in Harry's case that is only because of games he didn't play.
Still, it is sufficient grounds that I won't entirely hold that against Charlie.
More damning is the fact that Wood is captain his fifth, Harry's first, year,
and *Fred and George memorised Wood's speech from last year.*[^20200728-1]  Why
in the world was Charlie not captain in his seventh year? Why was a Fourth year
student given what is apparently the same rights as a prefect if a seventh year
student, who was both a good player and had been captain, was still available? 

So with a keeper (Wood) good enough to be made captain a year early, an
apparently excellent seeker (Charlie), and a decent if young pair of chasers
(Angelina and Alicia) Gryffindor could not win the 1990 season? This is a strong
argument that the above dates despite the pedigree of their source material
must be wrong, and that there must in fact be more space between Charlie and
Ron.
