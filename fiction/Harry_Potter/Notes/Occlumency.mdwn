## Occlumency

Occlumency is the art, one who practices it is an Occlumens.

This is another topic on which the books themselves are either incredibly
incomplete, or utterly impossible.  The interview quoted at the [Harry Potter
fandom wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/) on occulumency[^20191119-1] makes
the situation worse, not better.  In the interview, she is asserting that
Professor Snape's description of occulumency is accurate - that it is the
practice of compartmentalizing and/or suppressing emotion and memories. This is
further confirmed in her [article on
Draco](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/draco-malfoy) on what used to be Pottermore.[^20200630-7]

There are three problems with this.  One, it isn't really practical.  In
_The Grass Is Always Greener_[^20191119-2], Daphne describes what this would be
like in practice:

> Keep your eyes closed and let your mind go still. You can't think of nothing
  for very long, therefore you must think of something. So I want you to find a
  memory, or really an image, of something that is very neutral, very same, very
  uniform, and preferably all encompassing. It can be an image of the sky, the
  water in the ocean if you've been there, a large table cloth that's a single
  color, or whatever you know and can easily pull up.[^20191119-3]

Harry later figures out what this would be like to hold all the time:

> Harry had been diligently practicing his clearing of the mind every spare
  moment he had. He was proud of himself for a small break through he had had
  yesterday. He had finally figured out how to find the dark blanket, as he
  thought of it now, and still remain "normal". The result was something like a
  thin black haze across his vision and slightly reduced hearing. Still, now he
  knew he could have something of a shield up and still know what was going on
  around him, unlike being blind and almost deaf the first time he had done it
  with Daphne.[^20191119-4]

In that story, Harry choses the "view" of a room without light - total darkness.
This works, but basically means both reduced sight and, because he's partially
focusing on something else, reduced awareness overall.  Are you really going to
duel like that, as Professor Snape suggests when fighting Harry in Chapter 28 of
_the Half-Blood Prince_[^20191119-5]? People really can't effectively multitask
that way.  You can concentrate on your cleared mind, or on what is happening
around you (to be able to react to stray curses for example) but not on both.  

Secondly, it is not even really consistent.  Professor Snape is described
as a master at occulumency.  However, he is _constantly_ showing his anger,
hatred, and scorn.  It is not only the positive emotions that can be used
against you, anger can be used aginst you as well.  The man who cannot look past James Potter to
see Harry Potter cannot depend on compartmentalization to keep his mind in
control.  The man who totally loses it when, in that same chapter, Professor
Snape totally loses control just because Harry attempts to use his own
spell[^20191119-6] is a master at emotional control?  It does not make sense.  

Thirdly, shutting down emotions, suppressing them, is not particularly healthy.
While it is a common short term strategy, and can even be a viable one in the
fact of a trama situation, long term it will cause problems with your ability to
form and maintain interpersonal relationships[^20200630-4], long term health
problems (probably due to stress)[^20200630-5], and others that you can find on
google. Basically, it is really really bad advice for long term use.  On one
hand, it certainly describes Snape. On the other, is this really the
recommendation that Dumbledore has for Harry, whose supposed power is love?
Either it had no chance of working (which seems to be Mrs. Rowling's theory, in
the Draco article, but come on, really?) in which case Dumbledore really is
throwing Harry to the wolves, or Dumbledore does not really care about the
damage this might do to Harry, in which case he must not really much believe his
own theory about Harry's love being supper important.

The tone of the Draco article[^20200630-7] strongly implies that Harry had no
chance of getting Occlumency to work. I think it need not have been that way,
but I think it is clear at this point that
the author's intent for Occlumency is fairly clear.  The problem then is not so
much Occlumency, but rather [[Legilimency]].
