[[!meta title="List of Hogwarts Students by Year"]]
[[!toc levels=2 startlevel=3]]

I started out being incredibly strict, accepting only names from the listing of
the original forty and those I found in the books.  On being incredibly
frustrated with the dearth of names, however, I reluctantly expanded that to
accept some of the names from the video games as documented in what seems to me
to be the main [Harry Potter fan wiki][hpfd1].  While I am sure there are more
names in the wiki that, as of writing this, I have not yet come across, I have
enough data to have noticed that there are far far too many families with only
one child.  I know there is some grounds to believe that pure-blood families have
a bias towards having only one child, but they also want to preserve their
names.  Thus families with a girl should have a fairly strong tendency towards
having at least two children, even a pure-blood biased towards having only one
child would try a second time to get a male heir. 

Given the wide range of apparent ethnicity in the names, I think that the game
manufacturers gave in rather too strongly to a desire for inclusion and
diversity, and rather too little consideration to what 1800s and 1900s Britain
looked like. We must remember that the wizarding world tends to be around a
century, if not more, behind.

There is some ambiguity about Hannah's blood status.  See my notes on the
[[Abbott family|Families]]. 

Terry Boot appears to have attended his seventh year at [[Hogwarts]] despite the
laws against first generation students doing so.[^20210602-1]  This means either
my sources for him being a first generation student are wrong, or he was able to
fake an ancestry for himself. 

Mrs. Rowling's original notes put Kevin Entwhistle in Ravenclaw[^20200701-3],
but there are too many Ravenclaws and too many boys for her seeming desire for
symmetry. Given my [[argument about how students would be
sorted|Class_and_Blood]], I think he mutated to a Hufflepuff girl.  Based on the
same logic, Rivers is almost certainly a pure-blood, but might be a halfbood. 

The [[same argument|Class_and_Blood]] suggests the ambiguity of the [[Weasley]]
social class. 

Lots of fanfiction uses an extra female character named Fay Dunbar as one of the
girls in [[Harry's|Harry]] year.  This apparently comes from the _Harry Potter
and the Half-Blood Prince_ video game.[^20200706-2]  I see no indication in the
wiki article that Mrs. Rowling had influence in naming the extra characters in
the game versions. Unless I see otherwise, I'm going to assume that Fay and
Sophie are the same person, and will probably go with Sophie as the name.
