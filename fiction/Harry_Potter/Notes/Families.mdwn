### Belby family

Damocles Belby was taught by Slughorn and invented the Wolfsbane Potion, for
which he received an Order of Merlin.[^20210318-1]

### Black family

Unlike the Longbottom family, we have at least one cannon reference for the
blacks as a "noble" family.  We do not know if that means they were in fact
part of the peerage or not though.  A significant part of a ton of fanfiction
out there assumes there is a "family vault" that is controlled by a "Lord
Black." It also seems to be a reasonable supposition based on what the books do
state.  Many such fanfiction works further speculate that the Malfoy family
expects to inherit that control and that title.  If you take Mrs. Rowling's
Black family tree[^20210122-26] as part of cannon, such speculation is
baseless.  You have to be careful because she does not clearly distinguish
the male and female children, and because she does not put the children in
birth order on any given line, but if you work your way through it, once
Phineas Nigellus inherited, then the his son Sirius II was heir.
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion, [[Harry]]'s Godfather, descends from that line.
Assume that a godson cannot inherit - reasonable.  Next in line would be
Arcturus I, who had no male children, but decedents of Harfang Longbottom are
unlisted, that might include Neville.  Secondly, since we know that
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion was not properly disinherited because he _does_
inherit Grimmauld Place, it is reasonable to suspect that Cedrella Black might
not have been either, despite her marriage to Septimus Weasley.  If so, then the
[[Weasleys|Weasley]] would be in line after the Longbottoms (assuming it is a
different and now extinct branch of the Longbottom family that descends from
Harfang).  We _know_ that [[Arthur|adults/Arthur]] [[Weasley]], minimally, lives
to inherit, so there would be no need to go to the third son of Phineus Nigellus
- Cygnus I, from whom Draco is descended.  Remember, even if girls cannot
inherit, their sons can.   If the Black family is following an absolute male
only primogeniture, then Draco would still be unable to inherit as he is in line
via his mother, who would be disqualified by gender.  The dates for this line of
speculation are in the [[History]] timeline. 

On a side note, while it flies in the face of some of what I've written above,
Tigerman has an interesting theory in his work [RuneMaster][RMff1].  He suggests
that it is very odd that the portrait of Walburga Black should be so hard to
curtain and cover the way it is, and that more magic must be at work than just
the sticking charm.[^20210527-1] While is sense of story timeline is bizarre, I
do like this theory.

### Bones Family 

Susan Bones' grandparents are the ones killed by Riddle.[^20210301-1] She lost
an uncle, aunt, and cousins to one of the ten death eaters freed during _Order
of the Phoenix_.[^20210519-10]  She is [[listed|ClassLists]] as being a
halfblood, despite coming from a family with enough influence that her Aunt is
head of the [[DMLE|Culture]].[^20210701-1] How close is Susan's relationship with
her Aunt?  Is [[Amelia|adults/Amelia]] a traditionalist even if she also believes in
justice?[^20210701-2]  Or is Amelia fairly broad minded?[^20210701-3]

[^20210701-3]: This view of Amelia is shown in Fibinaci's _[Padfoot, Docteur
    D'amour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4510080)_.

    Finest Hour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13654352/1/Her-Finest-Hour). 

[^20210701-1]: I do not think you can advance *that high* in the Ministry without
    influence.  That might be political influence, familial influence, or the
    kind you get from knowing everyone's dirty laundry.

### Greengrass family

Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^20200520-1].
This is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly
debated.  A word search on the American Kindle edition shows her name only in
relation to the Charms OWL practicals.  Interestingly Pansy, Millicent and a 
Sixth Year girl are members of the Inquisitorial Squad, but Daphne is not.  
Why did Umbridge not trust her?

Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what we do
know about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as
part of cannon, something I tend not to do.  Mrs. Rowling says Astoria went
"through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from
pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^20200701-1] The interesting
thing about this paragraph is that it is nearly all innuendo and comparison
with few direct statements. It says *Daphne* is a Slytherin, but nothing of
Astoria's sorting.  It says Astoria believed pureblood ideals, but while
Draco's upbringing talks specifically about being a Death Eater upbringing,
there is a curious lack of specificity about Astoria. I find it curious that
Narcissa and Lucius "had high hopes" based on her family's status on the Sacred
Twenty-Eight.  If her father had been a Death Eater along with Lucius, surely
they would have more than merely that to base their hopes on?

### Longbottom Family

Lots of fanfiction puts the Longbottom family into the nobility.  I see no
indication of Augusta Longbottom being called "Lady Longbottom" outside of
fanfiction.  We have few descriptions of her, but her fox fur is described as
"moth eaten," which means that if they are part of the nobility, they are
impoverished. 

[^20200706-2]: [Harry Potter fandom wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki).

### Malfoy Family

Unlike the Longbottom family, there is a slight indication that the Malfoy
family might actually be ennobled.  While I see no indication of it in the books,
Mrs. Rowling's Pottermore writings talk about them getting a "prime piece of
land" for services to the King,[^20210330-3] something that probably came with a
title.  Since they apparently continued (per the same page) to be high class
socialites through the passage of the Statute of Secrecy,[^20210330-4] it seems
unlikely that they lost that title in the various periods of civil unrest
between the Norman conquest and the Statue's division of society into magical
and non-magical cultures.  They seem to have been influential with government
leaders, but not actually part of the magical government, ever
since.[^20210330-5]

On a side note, "Malfoy" is essentially "Bad faith" in French.  I highly doubt
that Mrs. Rowling intended this to have any real meaning except foreshadowing the
role that the family would play.  It would, however, be incredibly fun if it
*did* have meaning.  In a world where Astoria Greengrass can have a hereditary
curse,[^20210421-1] this should certainly be possible.  Considering that French
was a fairly well known language in the upper classes, I cannot imagine that the
name "Bad faith" did the Malfoy family any good mixing with the upper crust of
either society.  Sure they may have kept it out of stubborn pride, but it is much
more fun to imagine they had no choice but to keep the name.[^20210421-2]

[^20210421-1]: As best I can tell, Astoria's illness comes from the abominable
    play that was written as a sequel to the books.  I refuse to actually
    consider that cannon, but am using it here to highlight that my fiction is
    inherently compatible with Mrs. Rowling's creations.

### McLaggen Family

The McLaggen family is apparently well connected, sufficiently so to impress
Slughorn.[^20210318-2] Given Scrimgeour's behaviour across book six and the bit
of book seven he is alive for, my guess is that Scrimgeour is not a sympathiser
of the death eaters, but *is* strongly of the "might makes right" approach to
magic.  This is pure speculation, but my guess is that the two families are
probably both old money, and strongly invested in preserving the status quo.
They do not mind first generation magical users per-se, so long as they stay in
their place â at or near the bottom of the social order.

### Zabini

We really only know of Blaize Zabini.  We know his mother has been married seven
times, and that each of the seven husbands has died leaving her
money.[^20210318-3] We do not know which marriage produced Blaize, thus we do
not know if his mother has retained the same last name or not.
