#### Professor Minerva McGonagall

I really want to like Professor McGonagall, but so much that happens at Hogwarts
is troubling that I am conflicted about her. _The Board_[^20190823-1] by
[Clell65619](https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net) shows a critical view of her that I am, despite myself, really drawn to.  This view is more or less seconded by _[When Is It a Contract][WIIAC]_ which focuses on the conflicts between her roles as Deputy and Head of House.[^20210322-2]

Her timeline is ambiguous.  She joined Hogwarts at a time when there was more
than one teacher in the Transfiguration Department, approximately 2 or 3 years
after her graduation.[^20200720-7]  She informs Umbridge that she will have been
at Hogwarts "Thirty-nine years this December,"[^20200720-8] sometime in the
beginning of fifth year, or 1995. That puts her start date in 1956.
