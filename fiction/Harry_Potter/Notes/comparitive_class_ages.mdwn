[[!meta title="comparing how old students are in UK and US"]]

I frequently have trouble placing kids in the right frame of reference, because
I tend to think of them in terms of US grades, and not in terms of the ages they
are in those grades.  This should help with that. 

[[!table data="""
UK Grade | US Grade | Age range | Notes |
Reception | Pre-School | 4-5 | England calls this Infant or Primary School |
Year 1 | Kindergarten | 5-6 | |
Year 2 | 1st Grade | 6-7 | |
Year 3 | 2nd Grade | 7-8 | England calls this the start of Junior or Primary School |
Year 4 | 3rd Grade | 8-9 | |
Year 5 | 4th Grade | 9-10 | |
Year 6 | 5th Grade | 10-11 | Eleven plus exams in some areas of England, Key Stage 2 National Curriculum Tests.  In the US, Middle School may start here. | 
Year 7, old First Form | 6th Grade | 11-12 | England uses a variety of words for this, including
Middle School, High School, Secondary School, and the Lower Forms. | 
Year 8, old Second Form | 7th Grade | 12-13 | By this point Middle School in the US has
definitely started. | 
Year 9, old Third Form | 8th Grade | 13-14 | Key Stage 3 National Curriculum Tests, known as SATs (Standard Assessment Tests) |
Year 10, old Forth Form | 9th Grade | 14-15 | Start of the "Upper School", in the US the start of High School |
Year 11, old Fifth Form | 10th Grade | 15-16 | old O Level examinations, modern GCSE examinations |
Year 12, lower Sixth Form | 11th Grade | 16-17 | AS-level examinations | 
Year 13, upper Sixth Form | 12 Grade | 17-18 | A2-level examinations, both AS-levels and A2-levels count towards A-levels. |
