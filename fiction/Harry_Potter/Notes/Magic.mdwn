## Magic

### World-building

Where does magic come from?  How does it work?  What are the mechanics of it for
lack of a better word? 

We seem to have 
 * Wand Magic - curses, hexes, jinks, charms, transfiguration
 * Potions
 * Runes
 * Divination - tea cups, horoscopes, star charts, crystal balls, so on.
 * Arithmancy - Per Google, this should be part of Divination, but is apparently
   something different. 
 * Rituals - Riddle's resurrection seems to be a combination of elements of the
   above.  It is also interesting that it is normal spoken English where nothing
   else we see of magic is.

### Dark magic

Some magic is classified as being "dark."  Things so classified are harmful to
the caster, the victim, or both in some way.  If there is a victim, the results
are harder or even impossible to reverse.  In some places there is an
implication that it is also harder to even block. I need citations for this. 

#### Unforgivables

I have read fanfiction that tries to present the three unforgivable curses as
merely misunderstood bits of magic.  I dislike that idea.  Oh, there is some
logic to it, particularly for the Imperius curse, but overall it does not fit
with what we read in the books.  I need to look up the citations for this, but
there are a couple of key points.  

Fake professor Moody tells the class that the
killing curse requires true hate as well as power.  He asserts that the class
could cast it, but that he would be unlikely to get so much as a nose
bleed.[^20200731-4]  You do not hate an animal you are trying to kill
painlessly.  There is no obvious derivation from a spell used for animal
slaughter to one that _requires_ this kind of hatred to work.  The addition of
emotion may make a spell stronger, perhaps harder to block, but the spell as
described does not overpower shields, it goes right through them.  

Bellatrix tells Harry much the same thing when he fails to cast the cruciatus
curse on her.[^20200731-5]  There is no medical application for hating someone.
Sure you might envision medical applications for electrical stimulation (which
might have similar effects as the curse), or otherwise shocking someone.
However, your benign intent is the total inverse of that required for this
curse. 

In both cases these two curses are unforgivable in part because they are
difficult to shield against (I am assuming conjuration of stone is, for most
people, very hard, very draining, or very slow) and in part because of the mind
set required to cast them. 

We know less about the third, the imperious, and if the intent required is
merely to override someone's will, then it is easier to see situations where you
might justify it.  Ultimately I think what makes it so dangerous to society and
thus punished so heavily is that they have trouble detecting it.  If you cannot
know when someone has done something of their own will, you have utterly
undermined your entire ability to hold trials, establish order, and effectively
have civilisation.  

I have read in one fanfiction that, while it has some very troubling elements,
also has some really compelling world building elements, a view of unforgivables
and perhaps dark magic in general that is not wholly incompatible with the
above, but extends beyond it.  I am not sure it how cannon compatible it is, but
it certainly allows for a lot of flexibility.

This explains why the Death Eaters were so hard to fight, even though Aurors are
supposedly some of the most skilled at magic that you could find, requiring five
NEWTS with Exceeds Expectations including some of the harder
disciplines.[^20200731-7]  I *strongly* suspect that not all inner circle Death Eaters have
the same Exceeds Expectations or better in Charms, Transfiguration and Defence.
If what they have instead is a type of magic that levels the playing field, or
even tilts it the other way, a desperate Ministry losing the war might well
decide to authorise it, and leave it up to each individual Auror to judge the
cost.
