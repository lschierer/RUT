## Magic

[[!toc  startlevel=3]]

### World-building

Where does magic come from?  How does it work?  What are the mechanics of it for
lack of a better word? 

We seem to have 
* Spells - curses, hexes, jinks, charms, transfiguration
  * > The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures.[^20210304-5]
* Potions
* Runes
* Divination - tea cups, horoscopes, star charts, crystal balls, so on.
* Arithmancy - Per Google, this should be part of Divination, but is apparently
  something different. 
* Rituals - Riddle's resurrection seems to be a combination of elements of the
  above.  It is also interesting that it is normal spoken English where nothing
  else we see of magic is.

### Animagus

The common fanfiction idea is that you do not choose your animagus animal. I
am not sure what basis if any this has in the Cannon books, much less the
somewhat less canonical stuff that Mrs. Rowling has included in the various
websites and interviews dedicated to the series.  However, we do have one quote
that *suggests* otherwise:

> At a recent International Symposium of Animagi, the Uagadou School Team
> attracted a lot of press when their exhibition of synchronised transforming
> caused a near riot. Many older and more experienced witches and wizards felt
> threatened by fourteen-year-olds who could turn at will into elephants and
> cheetahs, and a formal complaint was lodged with the International
> Confederation of Wizards by Adrian Tutley (Animagus: gerbil).[^20210304-6]

If you do not chose your animal, a school team composed of people who are *all*
dual animagi elephants and cheetahs is not really plausible.  My guess is that
there are different ways to achieve the animagus transformation. If we posit
that, then it is possible that the particular method that European wizardry has
adopted and/or discovered a method that *does* include an involuntary choice of
animal, and *does* limit you to a single animal.  Being typically arrogant, the
British are unwilling to consider that someone else might have a better
approach.  When it is rubbed in their faces, Mr. Tutley of course reacts with a
law suit - if you are better than me, you must have done something
reprehensible.

### Healing

Healing seems to use charms for diagnosis, and a combination of spells (charms
and transfiguration?) and potions for the actual healing.  Per Mrs. Rowling:

> I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or
> override ‘mundane’ nature, but not ‘magical’ nature. Therefore, a wizard could
> catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would
> also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he
> might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in
> non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but
> the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or
> life-threatening.[^20210302-1]

Against this we have the fact that Percy wears horn-rimmed glasses[^20210302-2].
The question then becomes did the Weasleys not fix his eyesight because

* it is too costly to do so 
	* I know of at least one where it is "extremely painful and very expensive, not to
		mention very hard, to make"[^20210302-3] where "very expensive" means "a
		couple of thousand Galleons."[^20210302-4]
* it is morally distasteful to do so (requires dark magic?)
* it is not possible to do so (contradicts the above quote from the website)
  * from one fanfiction: 
	  > your homeostasis is having poor eyesight. Most healing magic works to get
		> things back to normal. If you cut your eye and then healed it, your eyesight
		> would remain the same. You'd have to purposefully leave a scar to leave an
		> impact, which would only happen with a cursed or highly magical injury.
		> Imagine! Cursing your own eyes to heal them, muggles are
		> deranged![^20210302-5]
* it does not occur to British pureblood society to do so 
  * You could take the above quote, and assume that the shop owner is actually
		only partially right.  Perhaps *most* healing magic returns you to "normal"
		and thus some forms of poor eye sight could not be affected by that magic.
		That would not preclude *uncommon* magic that changes your genetic
		predisposition to better eyesight, nor would it preclude magic fixing the
		need for glasses caused by eye strain, eye trauma, or other things that a
		muggleborn might show up in his shop with. 

### Dark magic

Some magic is classified as being "dark."  Things so classified are harmful to
the caster, the victim, or both in some way.  If there is a victim, the results
are harder or even impossible to reverse.  In some places there is an
implication that it is also harder to even block. I need citations for this. 

#### Unforgivables

I have read fanfiction that tries to present the three unforgivable curses as
merely misunderstood bits of magic.  I dislike that idea.  Oh, there is some
logic to it, particularly for the Imperius curse, but overall it does not fit
with what we read in the books.  I need to look up the citations for this, but
there are a couple of key points.  

Fake professor Moody tells the class that the
killing curse requires true hate as well as power.  He asserts that the class
could cast it, but that he would be unlikely to get so much as a nose
bleed.[^20200731-4]  You do not hate an animal you are trying to kill
painlessly.  There is no obvious derivation from a spell used for animal
slaughter to one that _requires_ this kind of hatred to work.  The addition of
emotion may make a spell stronger, perhaps harder to block, but the spell as
described does not overpower shields, it goes right through them.  

Bellatrix tells Harry much the same thing when he fails to cast the cruciatus
curse on her.[^20200731-5]  There is no medical application for hating someone.
Sure you might envision medical applications for electrical stimulation (which
might have similar effects as the curse), or otherwise shocking someone.
However, your benign intent is the total inverse of that required for this
curse. 

In both cases these two curses are unforgivable in part because they are
difficult to shield against (I am assuming conjuration of stone is, for most
people, very hard, very draining, or very slow) and in part because of the mind
set required to cast them. 

We know less about the third, the imperious, and if the intent required is
merely to override someone's will, then it is easier to see situations where you
might justify it.  Ultimately I think what makes it so dangerous to society and
thus punished so heavily is that they have trouble detecting it.  If you cannot
know when someone has done something of their own will, you have utterly
undermined your entire ability to hold trials, establish order, and effectively
have civilisation.  

I have read in one fanfiction that, while it has some very troubling elements,
also has some really compelling world building elements, a view of unforgivables
and perhaps dark magic in general that is not wholly incompatible with the
above, but extends beyond it.  I am not sure it how cannon compatible it is, but
it certainly allows for a lot of flexibility.

> "Those spells require the right mind set to work as intended," Nicholas said.
> "I dare say any magic user of moderate ability could cast one, but it would
> not be nearly as effective and could be blocked and it would be magically
> draining without the mind set. With the mind set, the spells are unblock-able
> and do not drain the caster. The problem is that mind set would mean you are
> no better than they are. To do the spells as intended, you cannot have any
> regard for human life at all. You must be evil to the core. The more you use
> those spells, the more proficient you become at them, the less human you
> remain and the more you become that which you're fighting. But Harry is right.
> Using those spells gives them an advantage in a fight one which can only be
> countered by a degree of skill most never attain.[^20200731-6]

This explains why the Death Eaters were so hard to fight, even though Aurors are
supposedly some of the most skilled at magic that you could find, requiring five
NEWTS with Exceeds Expectations including some of the harder
disciplines.[^20200731-7]  I *strongly* suspect that not all inner circle Death Eaters have
the same Exceeds Expectations or better in Charms, Transfiguration and Defence.
If what they have instead is a type of magic that levels the playing field, or
even tilts it the other way, a desperate Ministry losing the war might well
decide to authorise it, and leave it up to each individual Auror to judge the
cost.  

### Wands

* There is a fascinating article on [wand wood][20210126-1] and the
  personality traits and skills that go along with each.[^20200723-1]
* The one on [size and flexibility][20210126-2] is more abbreviated, but points 
  out that you must not be too literal.[^20200723-2]
* Olivander has researched wand cores and will use only three of
  them.[^20200723-3]  Others are possible, but [the article on cores][20210126-3]
	was, like the other two, written as if by him and so focuses on those three.

Given the above articles I talk some about [[Harry]]'s wand on the page
dedicated to him.  Riddle's wand, I think it is fairly inevitable that he would
have a yew wand, but I am somewhat surprised that he would have a phoenix
feather core.  While it does say it is the most capable, in a sense, it says
dragon heartstring is the most powerful.  Would Riddle value range and or power
more?  He would certainly dislike that the phoenix feather wand might sometimes
act of its own accord.[^20200806-5]  Naturally eleven year old Riddle knows
nothing of wand lore and so is not deciding this, yet still, the wand must sense
something of the wizard it is bonding with…

### The Wards around Privet Drive and The Trace

First of all, I am not going to spend much time worrying about whether or not
"wards" are part of the cannon universe or not.  The books may never use the
word, but the concept certainly exists.  The books provide no consistent name
for area affect protection magics, particularly not long lasting ones.  I am
going to join most of fanfiction and call these magics wards.  The books use all
sorts of names, and in some places descriptions of effects without naming the
magic behind it at all (you cannot apparate in Hogwarts).  I need a word, and
"ward" works well.

In the cannon Harry Potter universe, the wards were set to fail when Harry turns
17, becoming an adult.  This has lead some fanfiction authors to speculate that
any event that causes Harry to be emancipated would also cause the wards to
fail.  Per the books, the wards were stood up when Petunia took Harry into her
home.[^20180709-2]  I have to deal with this in this in any story.  How exactly do the
wards work, and what protection do they provide?  A related question is The
Trace, which also terminates at 17.  I initially considered that the wards might
not have activated, as this would both be a bit of ironic justice and make the
story easier.  If the wards do not change when Harry gets married because they
are not working right in the first place, I do not have to deal with the
emancipation that also comes with the marriage.  However, I dislike
contradicting the text when it comes to world mechanics more than I have to.  I
mean, I do have to some - wizarding households function on magic, so the Decree
for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the Trace either allows
for supervised household charm or does not function at all in wizarding
households, probably the latter.  The whole "do not use magic outside of school"
thing is more for muggle born witches and wizards rather than any real
restriction.  Returning to topic, another possibility is that turning 17 is a
magical event - literally.  Because Harry never takes arithmancy in the books,
we do not see much about magic numbers, but we know they exist.  Perhaps this
particular prime number impacts the operation of the wards (and the Trace must
be some form of detection ward I think) in some way.  If that is true, then
Harry's emancipation is a legal event, not a magical one, and so would not
affect either the Trace or the wards.
