### Class Schedules Rant

These pretty much must be intended more as a plot device than any serious
attempt at sitting down and figuring out how to schedule classes for four houses
across seven years with only one teacher per subject. Any number of people have 
tried to figure this out, and I've seen a few claim to make work, though I do
not have any of their results on hand.  Still, a number of the problems should
be self-evident if you pay any attention to detail at all. ChokolatteJedi wrote
over 18 thousand words across 3 chapters trying to make sense of the
schedules[^20200629-1] in what looks like a fairly well researched work that
outlines most of the holes, problems, and inconsistencies.

I can accept that taking five electives on top of a course load that
theoretically kept students well occupied for 2 years might over work and stress
out even the best student.  There might well be good reason for limiting most
students to two of three electives.  That being said, it boggles my mind that
Hermione would be scheduled in _three_ classes for first period Monday morning.
One of two things is happening here.  Either, as I said, the schedule is a total
plot device and the three classes are on top of each other simply to make
Hermione's schedule obviously insane, or some of the classes actually have two
sessions per year, and McGonagall has purposefully put Hermione in an "odd"
session, perhaps attempting to make it less obvious that she is taking
overlapping classes.  

Of the two of these, the former, that it is purely a plot
device actually makes more sense.  If there are two classes that no student can
actually ever take at the same time (seems odd given that all classes are being
signed up for years and not just single semesters) then they would need to be
carefully chosen so that no career ever imagined would ever need both.
Alternately, they would have to be chosen such that if some career needed a
passing, but not in depth knowledge of one class and an in depth knowledge of
the other, the more necessary class would also have to cover the less necessary
course overview. Thus I could see that divination, which is a truly broad topic,
might cover a unit on arithmancy as it relates to divination even though I am
fairly sure that in the Hogwarts universe the term is used rather losely to
refer to any use of numbers in magic and not the dictionary definition. The idea
that no one could take Divination and Muggle Studies, nor Arithmancy and Muggle
Studies is rather odd. One would think that there would be at least one career
somewhere that would benefit from predicting muggle behavior, events that impact
muggles, events that might breach the statue of secrecy, or similar. 

It is also apparent that the electives and class scheduling primarily appear as
a plot device if you look at attendence in the classes. It appears that very
nearly if not _every single Gryffindor_ in Harry's year (unless you credit the
idea that there are unnamed ones like Fay Dunbar) is taking Divination and Care
of Magical Creatures. Really? There is all this talk about the students stressing 
over their choices and then watch all eight of them pick the exact same two
courses (except Hermione of course who picks all of them)? Is that really
likely?
