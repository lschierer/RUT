## Hogwarts

[[!toc levels=2 startlevel=3]]

### Founding

Godric is from Old English, also dying out after the Norman
Conquest.[^20210422-5] I am told, and the baby names etymology site seems to
concur, that "Old English" essentially means "Anglo-Saxon."[^20210422-6] He is
supposedly from a village later renamed after him, in the West
Country.[^20210422-8] This more or less works, the vikings might well have
pushed the Anglo-Saxon west enough by the time Godric was born.[^20210422-9]

For the other three we have only geographic clues that could mean anything,
though other fans with presumably more knowledge of the United Kingdom have made
inferences that supposedly make sense.

Helga is an Old Norse name, used in England "before the Norman
Conquest."[^20210422-4] The consensus is that she is from Wales.[^20210422-10]
The name and location pair is a conundrum, she should be from one of the Viking
invasions, but I do not know of those settling in Wales. Perhaps this is why she
ended up migrating north, her family was perhaps unwelcome in their home
town/village. 

Rowena is an interesting name in that it apparently has an unclear etymology. I
find very different explanations on different name origin sites, and Wikipedia
pretty much just says unknown.[^20210422-3] The consensus is that she is from
what is now Scotland,[^20210422-11] though of course that did not exist
yet.[^20210422-12]

Salazar is a *last name* from Castile.[^20210422-7] Vikings certainly raided
the Iberian Peninsula through this century,[^20210422-13] my guess is that
someone decided to name a child after one of the places they pillaged. As his
wand is snakewood,[^20210422-14] which is not native to Europe, I think his
Viking origin is fairly solid. I suspect he at some point joined a voyage to the
new world, but given where snakewood exists, he must have heard rumours of the
various civilisations further south and gone to study with them for a time.  From
my own knowledge of the Aztecs and Toltecs suggests that this would not have
been a positive influence on his life.  If he was attracted to the dark arts, it
may well date from this period. 

That the four of them meet at all, and more, become friends, suggests that while
this period of history is a series of rather small kingdoms at war in the United
Kingdom, the magical civilisation must have been more broadly connected despite
the non-magical politics.  Otherwise the idea that Godric would make his way
from the West Country in the southern most parts of England up across at least
one other kingdom into a third in the tenth century is rather absurd. Why would
you? There were no organised trade networks that widely spread, no real centres
of scholarship in England or Scotland at all yet, and lots of very suspicious
people who would dislike and probably attack you for being foreign.  

My guess is that Hogwarts is in Scotland because Helga was unwelcome at home,
Salazar was functionally nomadic, and of the two remaining founders, Rowena's
home in Scotland was probably more easily isolated and hidden from the
non-magical population than Godric's in the south.

### General Info

#### [[Class Schedule|Class_Schedule_Rant]]

#### Punishments

During Harry's time there, Filch constantly complains about the punishments he
is and is not allowed to inflict.  I do not know as much about the change in
societal norms on school punishments in British boarding schools as I would need
to know in order to fully evaluate what happens at Hogwarts.  That being said,
we do know that punishments were more extreme not all that long in the past.

> Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling. “Your father and I had been for a
> nighttime stroll,” she said. “He got caught by Apollyon Pringle he was the
> caretaker in those days your father’s still got the marks.”[^20200720-9]

Note that Mrs. Weasley is not expressing any negative emotion here.  She's
recounting something she expects Harry and Bill to hear and accept without much
surprise.  A Guardian article that is the top Google result when I try to look
up corporal punishment in British schools tells me that Harry probably never
experienced any, but quite possibly heard about it.[^20200720-10]

#### The Trophy Room

This did not occur to me until it was pointed out, but why does the Trophy Room
contain Riddle's Award for Special Services to the School at all?[^20210520-1]
I do not know if this is typical of British schools or not, by my own high
school's trophy case only contained team trophies, awards won by the school as a
whole, and trophies intended to be presented to a student year after year
(typically containing a multitude of mini plaques on them one of which would get
engraved each year).  Something specific to a single student should be *that
student's*.  The trophy case did not contain the various medals the guys on my
wrestling team won at tournaments, nor did it contain the ones I got at science
fairs.

### Students

Cannon focuses on [[Harry]]'s classmates almost exclusively.  [Harry's
Yearmates](https://mugglenet.com/2016/03/the-revised-forty/)[^20200419-1] is
probably the best source for almost cannon information, though _Secrets of the
Classlist_[^20200630-1] also contains a ton.  The two disagree on a few things.
Some of this has been corrected by Mrs. Rowling,[^20200630-3] most of it has
not. In general, the latter is better researched, the former easier to find
information in. Information on the class lists for pretty much any other year is
entirely absent. One would think that in an age where people obsessively wiki
things (myself not really excluded), someone would have compiled the available
data, but if so I have not found it.  Thus, I have started [[this
list|ClassLists]].

One of the problems with the above two sources is that I've ended up with 6
first generation wizards, 11 halfboods and 18 purebloods in Harry's class.  This
gives me a class that is 45% pureblooded, despite Mr. Weasley being quoted as
saying that purebloods are dying out, and that most families are
halfblooded.[^20200817-1]  Some of that may be the influence of the first Riddle
war, where entire families were wiped out.  I imagine the halfblooded families
were disproportionately affected by that.  If there should be about 1000
students at Hogwarts,[^20200817-2] then we should have 35-36 per house per year,
not 40 per year total.  If we had 140 students in Harry's year, then the
18 purebloods would be only 13% of the class, and the muggleborn only 4%.  

That assumes that all 116 students killed by Riddle are halfblooded (or at least
that the ones that were pureblooded would be in different years), which is
probably not totally true but more nearly true than not.  However, there is
another interesting possibility.  As best I can recall, _the Deathly Hallows_
never says what happens to the first generation wizards who should have been
part of that year's first year class.  We know that some of the older ones went
into hiding, some of them successfully, some not.[^20200819-2] On the other
hand, it seems like at least some of them attended Hogwarts anyway, based on the
people present in the Room of Requirement when Harry makes it
there.[^20200819-3]  

Another possibility is that the Death Eaters used contacts within the Ministry
of Magic's Accidental Magic Reversal Squad or the Improper Use of Magic office
to get word of under aged magic users, and to kill the muggle ones.[^20200819-4]
If so, the same work suggests that they may have killed *fewer* of them in the
years between the two Riddle wars, but not completely stopped.  This would
artificially deflate the number of first generation wizards not just in Harry's
year, but in all of the classes we see in the books.  While Mr. Weasley's
"Muggle Protection Act" argues against this idea, it does seem believable of
Umbridge and those like her who set up the laws under Pius Thicknesse's puppet
government. 

One of the other interesting questions is how you would handle an extra 29 or 30
students per house per year.  At 10 students per house per year, the common
rooms hold 70 students; at 35 they hold 245.  The former figure is big enough it
does not sound like it would really work - how would that many students actually
survive trying to occupy that space as their primary place to relax every
evening? The latter is frankly impossible.  It means that each common room has
nearly as many people as the entire school does at the 10/house/year figure. 

Like I do below when I look at teachers, I am tempted to use _[Stalky &
Co.](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3006)_ by Rudyard Kipling as a secondary
source to course correct.  That book had what sounds very like a common room per
year for the younger students, with the older students of each house broken out
into "studies" - groups of 3-5 students sharing a common living space.
Several references make it sound like they sleep in the studies, but others make
it sound like they have dorms separate from them. 

Gryffindor does not seem to have any corollary to _Stalky_'s studies.  However,
it seems reasonable that it might have multiple common rooms, the rest of which
are shutdown and disused.  Having pre-teens mixed in with your upper form
students studying for their OWLs and NEWTs seems less than ideal, on the other
hand having a common room maintained for 30 or 40 students when each can
(apparently) hold 70 probably means too little supervision given the
proportionate lack of staff.  

If you put 1st and 2nd year together, 3rd and 4th year together, and assume not
everyone came back for NEWTs, then you have 3 common rooms, 2 at 70ish each, and
one that is variably sized depending on the size of the two NEWT classes.
However, it probably works reasonably well as NEWT students are too busy (not to
mention being older anyway) to be too rowdy.  Assign a junior teacher to monitor
the junior forms for the day time hours in shifts, and the prefects are
responsible for keeping the house quiet after curfew.  That might work.

[^20200819-2]:  I'm assuming that both Dean Thomas and the Death Eaters would
    have regarded Dean as a first generation wizard.  We are told Dean did not know
    about his father, and if the Death Eaters did, they would have considered him a
    blood traitor anyway. Thus that makes at least one student who went into hiding
    unsuccessfully. 

[^20200819-3]: It certainly does not mention nearly enough people coming through
    the portrait tunnel, and pretty much his entire class, plus both Creevy boys
    seem to be there.  Get a citation for this.

### Teachers

* [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]
* [[Cuthbert Binns|Binns]]
* [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]]
* [[Severus Snape|Snape]]

In more general terms, what is the role of the head of each house?
[[McGonagall]] shows up to intervene in Gryffindor's internal discipline only in
Harry's third year.[^20200811-1]  Harry finds Luna wandering the halls barefoot,
posting flyers listing her stolen stuff, and Flitwick does nothing.[^20200811-2]
I have a page dedicated to [[McGonagall]], and it would be hard to write too
much here that would not also go there, so these two examples will have to
suffice for now.  It seems that the school expects the prefects to run the
school.  I am unsure how typical of British boarding schools this is, Stalky of
_[Stalky & Co.](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3006)_ by Rudyard Kipling goes
on an extended rant about the evils of married teachers, and how it puts too
much responsibility on the prefects.[^20210521-6] _Stalky & Co._ is certainly
idealised, no doubt in a lot of ways, but if you read carefully you can tell
there is a lot of bullying, it is a rough life, but it is kept sufficiently in
check that most of them come out of it … typically British.  If *Stalky* thinks
that it would be *worse* if the teachers he describes do *less*, well, then we
have to assume that the few phrases we have hinting at the problems within
Hogwarts are actually understating things. 

Look at the roles that play out in _Stalky_ versus _Harry Potter_.  In _Stalky_
we see prefects giving out discipline, including corporal punishment, but each house
has a head that advocates for its students, steps in for discipline problems
within the house beyond the scope or abilities of the prefects, and is generally
present and visible not just as a teacher, but _as a head of house_.  Indeed, in
_Stalky_, the prefects are rarely mentioned, several of the school masters who
head Houses are the most frequent disciplinarians (this might be because Stalky
has the prefects totally intimidated).  The Head is called in for exceptional
problems, and if I recall, the punishment is made especially severe to
discourage "bothering the Head."  Does any of this sound like Hogwarts?  At
Hogwarts every problem most likely not at all, otherwise by the prefects, and
finally, by Dumbledore with [[Snape]] attending as advisor, no matter who is
involved.  Never mind [[McGonagall]] is Deputy Head, and therefore more
logically the advisor at that point, we need a more Charles Dickens feel about
it.  Which is probably precisely the point.
