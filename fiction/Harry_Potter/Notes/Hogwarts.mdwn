### Students

[Harry's
Yearmates](https://mugglenet.com/2016/03/the-revised-forty/)[^20200419-1] is
probably the best source for information, though _Secrets of the
Classlist_[^20200630-1] also
contains a ton.  The two disagree on a few things. Some of this has been
corrected by Mrs. Rowling,[^20200630-3] most of it has not. In general, the latter is
better researched, the former easier to find information in. Information on the
class lists for pretty much any other year is entirely absent. One would think
that in an age where people obsessively wiki things (myself not really
excluded), someone would have compiled the available data, but if so I have not
found it.

Mrs. Rowling's original notes put Kevin Entwhistle in Ravenclaw[^20200701-3], but there are
too many Ravenclaws and too many boys for her seeming desire for symmetry. Given
my [[argument about how students would be sorted|Class_and_Blood]], I think he
mutated to a Hufflepuff girl.  Based on the same logic, Rivers is almost
certainly a pureblood, but might be a halfbood. 

The [[same arguement|Class_and_Blood]] suggests the ambiguity of the Weasley
social class. 

Lots of fanfiction uses an extra female character named Fay Dunbar as one of the
girls in Harry's year.  This apparently comes from the _Harry Potter and the
Half-Blood Prince_ video game.[^20200706-2]  I see no indication in the wiki
article that Mrs. Rowling had influence in naming the extra characters in the
game versions. Unless I see otherwise, I'm going to assume that Fay and Sophie
are the same person, and will probably go with Sophie as the name.
