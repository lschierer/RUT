[Harry's
Yearmates](https://mugglenet.com/2016/03/the-revised-forty/)[^20200419-1] is
probably the best source for information, though _Secrets of the
Classlist_[^20200630-1] also
contains a ton.  The two disagree on a few things. In general, the latter is
better researched, the former easier to find information in. Information on the
class lists for pretty much any other year is entirely absent. One would think
that in an age where people obsessively wiki things (myself not really
excluded), someone would have compiled the available data, but if so I have not
found it.
