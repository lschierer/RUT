## Hogwarts

### General Info

#### [[Class Schedule|Class_Schedule_Rant]]

#### Punishments

During Harry's time there, Filch constantly complains about the punishments he
is and is not allowed to inflict.  I do not know as much about the change in
societal norms on school punishments in British boarding schools as I would need
to know in order to fully evaluate what happens at Hogwarts.  That being said,
we do know that punishments were more extreme not all that long in the past.

> Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling. “Your father and I had been for a
> nighttime stroll,” she said. “He got caught by Apollyon Pringle he was the
> caretaker in those days your father’s still got the marks.”[^20200720-9]

Note that Mrs. Weasley is not expressing any negative emotion here.  She's
recounting something she expects Harry and Bill to hear and accept without much
surprise.  A Guardian article that is the top google result when I try to look
up corporal punishment in British schools tells me that Harry probably never
experienced any, but quite possibly heard about it.[^20200720-10]

schools Harry likely attended, 1986 for British state schools, and 2000 for
Scotish private schools. 

### Students

[Harry's
Yearmates](https://mugglenet.com/2016/03/the-revised-forty/)[^20200419-1] is
probably the best source for information, though _Secrets of the
Classlist_[^20200630-1] also
contains a ton.  The two disagree on a few things. Some of this has been
corrected by Mrs. Rowling,[^20200630-3] most of it has not. In general, the latter is
better researched, the former easier to find information in. Information on the
class lists for pretty much any other year is entirely absent. One would think
that in an age where people obsessively wiki things (myself not really
excluded), someone would have compiled the available data, but if so I have not
found it.

Mrs. Rowling's original notes put Kevin Entwhistle in Ravenclaw[^20200701-3], but there are
too many Ravenclaws and too many boys for her seeming desire for symmetry. Given
my [[argument about how students would be sorted|Class_and_Blood]], I think he
mutated to a Hufflepuff girl.  Based on the same logic, Rivers is almost
certainly a pureblood, but might be a halfbood. 

The [[same arguement|Class_and_Blood]] suggests the ambiguity of the Weasley
social class. 

Lots of fanfiction uses an extra female character named Fay Dunbar as one of the
girls in Harry's year.  This apparently comes from the _Harry Potter and the
Half-Blood Prince_ video game.[^20200706-2]  I see no indication in the wiki
article that Mrs. Rowling had influence in naming the extra characters in the
game versions. Unless I see otherwise, I'm going to assume that Fay and Sophie
are the same person, and will probably go with Sophie as the name.

Lots of fanfiction puts the Longbottom family into the nobility.  I see no
indication of Augusta Longbottom being called "Lady Longbottom" outside of
fanfiction.  We have few descriptions of her, but her fox fur is described as
"moth eaten," which means that if they are part of the nobility, they are
impoverished.
