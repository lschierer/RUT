This tree is speculative based on the available information.  Charlus Potter is
placed based on Dorea Potter's birthday, and Henry Potter's dates of service in
the Wizengamot.  It is unlikely that Henry's child's wife was born as Henry
retired from public service.  It is more likely that his term in the Wizengamot
came in recognition for success in some prior career and thus later in life,
after his child(ren) are/were born. Since that pushes the connection up a
generation, I'm inserting a missing couple between Henry's mum (whose last name
was Fleamont) and Charlus (who had to be young enough to marry Dorea).  Sure
marriages happen with mismatched ages, but I think most witches and wizards
marry right out of Hogwarts.  I have no real basis for that belief, the Weasley
children contradict it, but I think it fits the culture I am envisioning. 

It is worth noting that the family tree developed on the Harry Potter fandom
wiki disagrees with the placement for Charlus Potter.[^20210303-1]

There is another possibility to consider.  It is quite a coincidence that the
Potters would happen to have someone on the Wizengamot to debate the Statute of
Secrecy and World War I.   This is especially true if you consider that Henry
was part of the Wizengamot for a year before the war.[^20210517-12] It is
possible that the Wizengamot is in fact hereditary, but that most Potters
appoint proxies, preferring to remain uninvolved in politics.[^20210517-13]
This theory is rather a stretch though.

    The page states that "a member of the family has twice sat on the
    Wizengamot."
