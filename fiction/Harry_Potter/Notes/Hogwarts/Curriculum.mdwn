[[!meta title="Hogwarts Curriculum"]]
Has Hogwarts always had the same classes we see during Harry's time as a
student?  Was alchemy at one time a more regularly scheduled elective?  Were
there ever classes in the arts or in languages?  For most of its history,
literacy was not universal, did Hogwarts have classes in writing, composition,
reading, or arithmetic, if so, did the need for these classes contribute to the
prejudice against those from non-magical backgrounds?  Or were these subjects
handled by one-on-one tutoring (with the same result, since it probably had
more of an impact on the student's performance in the normal classes)?  The
spells we see all seem to have a Latin basis.  What effect did the Norse
invasions on Great Britain have on the magical populations?[^20210812-1]  Did
it effect the spells that were taught, the classes available?  

These are not idle questions.  We know that Dumbledore was disinclined to
"allow the subject of Divination to continue at all"[^20210928-6] when hearing
[[Trelawney]] actually give a prophecy changed his mind.  We are also told that
specialised subjects (plural), of which Alchemy is the only provided example,
are sometimes provided for NEWT students.[^20210928-7]  Moreover, as you answer
these questions, the overall impossibility of the [[class
schedule|Class_Schedule_Rant]] comes more and more into play.  

As I stated in my [[rant|Class_Schedule_Rant]], a few authors have attempted to
make sense of [[Hogwarts]]' class scheduling, class offerings, and related
material.  It is a difficult question.  _[Enough][WAAE1]_ by White Angel of
Auralon is one of the most interesting that I have seen, but ultimately fails
because it does not fully explore the changes in government that must have
occurred over the six and a piece centuries (possibly seven and a piece) between
the founding of the school and the Statue of Secrecy.[^20210929-1]  I have
trouble believing that the wizards maintained a single unified government across
the islands when the non-magical world never had one before the (most
optimistically) James VI of Scotland became James I of England, and even that is
a debatable earliest date.[^20210929-2]  The second problem with this solution
is that it posits a number of different schools across Britain, when Rowling
tells us that few countries maintain their own schools, and that schools have
frequently been targeted during magical wars.[^20210929-3]  Many authors make
much of Hagrid's statement that Hogwarts is the finest school, but he is making
a *global* comparison, not a *British* comparison.[^20210929-4]  We do not
actually know if there are (or in the case of the above fan fiction, ever have
been) *any* other British schools.
