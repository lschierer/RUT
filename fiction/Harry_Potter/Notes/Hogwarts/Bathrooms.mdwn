[[!meta title="Bathrooms at Hogwarts"]]

Mrs. Rowling explains that the Chamber of Secrets was not always hidden under a
sink in a girl's restroom.[^20210525-1] This is one of the places where Mrs.
Rowling is particularly hard to make consistent.  She has dated the remodelling
of Hogwarts to include bathrooms to the eighteenth century,[^20210928-1] but
Dumbledore was born at the end of the *nineteenth* century, and references
finding a collection of chamber pots.[^20210928-2]  So far so good, who knows
how long that collection has sat unused for, it could be two years or two
centuries and there would be little difference.  It becomes impossible to
reconcile when you add in her statement that Wizards "relieved themselves
wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence."[^20210928-3]  

Her dating of its conversion in the eighteenth century is probably the common
mistake of forgetting that century numbers are a digit in advance of the printed
date, so the eighteenth century would be the 1700s, a bit too early from what I
read.[^20210525-2] That aside, her explanation[^20210525-3] for what they did
instead is, in my opinion, a historical exaggeration because potty humour
appeals to many young readers.  While chamber pots and outdoor
privies[^20210525-4] may have been the norm for Britain when Hogwarts was built,
a magical society connected enough to have a concept of "International" in
1298[^20210525-5] should be sufficiently in touch with Byzantium to still have a
Roman understanding of public latrines based around running water.[^20210525-6]
Indeed, this is hinted at by the very passage that states that bathrooms are a
late additions to the building, it says that the plumbing "became more
elaborate," not that it was entirely new.[^20210928-4]  If the plumbing system
pre-dated the second floor bathroom, for what was it used?  

In _[For Want of an Outfit][FWO1]_ CmptrWz provides a an amusing viable
alternative that is clearly attempting to work within the limits that Mrs.
Rowling's explanation for the Chamber creates.  CmptrWz proposes that Hogwarts
*did* primarily use chamber pots, and thus had no male or female restrooms until
their introduction in 1815.[^20210525-7] CmptrWz then has the amusing idea that
while the prefects designated two of the converted rooms male restrooms and two
female, the faculty failed to actually create any official rules around this.
The thing is that I can almost see some ancient (in terms of personal age)
headmaster somewhat bemusedly authorising his prefects to install these modern
contrivances while being personally nearly as isolated from the school as
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] is.  Such a headmaster might well have failed
to fully think through the implications of replacing chamber pots with restrooms
and thus fail to amend the school rules to prohibit males in the female
restroom and vice versa.  This is almost as whimsical as Mrs. Rowling's potty
humour, I suppose, but I find a mentally deficient headmaster failing to create
rules around student safety to be totally in line with Hogwarts, whereas a general
lack of hygiene is just … distasteful.  This also explains away a second
inconsistency:  The [[Founders|Founding]], a subset of them, were clearly very
worried about the fact that Hogwarts was a co-ed school.  The girl's dorms are
protected such that boys cannot enter, and yet the girl's bathrooms are not?
Right or wrong, the current furror over bathrooms indicates that the concern
would occur.[^20210928-5]
