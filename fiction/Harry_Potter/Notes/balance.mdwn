[[!meta title="Balance of Power"]]

One of the troubling things about the world that Mrs. Rowling has created is
that it is unbalanced towards being fallen.  This is perhaps no where so obvious
as in the case of the so called [[non-beings|non-being]].  With the exception of
[[poltergeists]], which are apparently based on "chaos,"[^211020-10] all of
these "non-beings" are evil creatures.  While I am okay with [[Dark
Magic|Magic]] being difficult to impossible to fully repair to some extent, I
have limits.  I can accept the idea of acts having consequences that require
divine intervention to fully heal.  I cannot accept that *if* magic is not
fundamentally tainted (as in the real world it would have to be if it existed),
that it *is* fundamentally unbalanced towards evil.  

* Evil creatures are indestructible, but on the side of good, the closest we
  come is the phoenix which seems to have a rather useless form of immortality,
  and *can* heal, but only if you can earn the loyalty of the bird in question
  (to get them).[^211020-11]
* Evil spells cannot be blocked, cannot be fully healed, may in fact be fully
  irreversible.  The only good equivalent is a mysterious magic that Lily
  invoked that no one actually understands.
* potions alone seems somewhat balanced with things like the death potion
  balanced by the elixir of life, and debates on the exact effects of the
  draught of living death.  
* While mandrakes might be useful, there seems to be more plants that harm you
  than plants that conspicuously help you. 

Why do we not have shields that cannot be breached, or can only be cast to
protect someone else, but are stronger than standard shields?  Why do we not
*see* instances of the healing magic that Mrs. Rowling implies makes mundane
health problems irrelevant?  Harry should be healed of his vision problems,
someone else cured after being crushed by a giant (since that is, in essence a
mundane injury), or after a catastrophic fall from a broom (explaining why
[[Madam Pomfrey|adults/Pomfrey]] hates Quidditch).  Since dementors play an
important role, so to should some of the more benevolent creatures.  Sure,
Fawkes is critical with the basilisk, but that creature is so evil it needs its
own balance.  And yes, Buckbeak shows up a few times, but so too do Acromantula,
which, again, are mostly evil.  

In short, magic seems to have massively escalated the fallen nature of the
world.
