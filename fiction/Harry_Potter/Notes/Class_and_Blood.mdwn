## Class and Blood Status in the Magical World

I think the case can be made that there are those who think wizarding
traditions, culture, and probably even blood lines are important, but that not
all of them are _evil._  Some of them object to Riddle's violence, bloodshed,
and/or cruelty even if they would support the pure-blood supremacy he nominally
espouses.  Of these people I think it would be well to remember that non-magical
aristocracy had similar prejudices about bloodlines, giving English society a
distinctly caste-like look and feel for centuries.  

Inbreeding among the aristocracy was prevalent enough that some recessive genetic conditions became
problematic for them, most notably the clotting disorder that some of Europe's
royals carried.  It is hardly surprising that the magical world would have
adopted similar attitudes, and if their lifespans are truly longer on average
(Harry's OWLs are administered by an examiner who also administered the NEWT exams for Professor Dumbledore[^20210220-1]), 
then their isolation would make it an even bigger and longer lasting
problem that could easily persist to Harry's time.  I suspect that pure-blood is
actually an over simplification of the average pure-blood's world view.  I suspect that
Mrs. Rowling, being focused on school kids, simply did not expose us to the
class structure that _must_ have carried over from the non-magical world as the
Statute of Secrecy gave a final divide to the two societies.  

Thus while some may have been obsessive about blood, I'm going to bet the real reason the
Crabbes or the Goyles are not part of the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" is that they are _servants._  It is not
that I am ignoring or discounting Mrs. Rowling's
[article](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood) on the origin and
development of the idea of pure-blood and half-blood status.  It is simply that
while yes, I am an outsider looking in, I can see no way that any society based
on English society in the late 1600s can _not_ have a strong caste component to
it.  The counter balance would be that all of them go to Hogwarts, which forces a 
degree of social mixing that caste based societies rarely tolerate. That,
combined with the overall lack of population, and doubtless a bias towards
controlling magical power by marrying strong witches or wizards into the family
regardless of status, would have created some degree of levelling, raising the
lowest castes up some, reducing the aristocracy from untouchable lord-lings to
something more like clan chiefs. But class consciousness was bred strongly into
your average British person.  So strongly that you see it consistently in all of
their literature, be it Jane Austen (born 1775), Charles Dickens (born 1812),
Arthur Conan Doyle (born 1859), Agatha Christie (born 1890), or Evelyn Waugh (born 1903).
I could name others, but the selection above has authors with works published across the time-span
to account from within a generation or at most two of the Statute of Secrecy through the
publishing of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. 

If you think about it, this would help make sense of what goes on as Riddle
rises to power during the 1960s and 1970s.  There are families like the Potters
who are pure-bloods, but essentially by chance.  I suspect they have historically
been fairly class conscience, but not bought into the whole Slytherin blood
status mess.  However, in the magical world, most upper class girls would have
come from other magical families, so more or less accidentally the Potters are
mostly pure-bloods.  The same is probably true of the Weasleys, Longbottoms,
Abbotts, and any others who made up the minority who protested their inclusion
on the Sacred Twenty-Eight list.  

The Weasleys apparently became notorious for their protest, and incited a great
deal of hatred.  That hatred in a renaissance, if not positively medieval
society, would have triggered feuding, and would explain their present state.
The current Weasley family we know lives on a fairly good sized plot of land in
a part of England where I am told land is fairly expensive, but the house on
that land is cobbled together with a substantial portion of do-it-yourself
construction and a whole lot of home grown magic.  They have lost most of their
wealth, including any hereditary home(s), but not all of the land that was once
attached to that home.  Arthur has a middling high, but not prominent, position
in the ministry, and apparently has lots of connections and a fair amount of
influence.  This makes sense if you view them as impoverished aristocracy, a
family who has lost a lot, but retains vestiges of their former influence and
power. 

Returning to my thoughts on Riddle's rise to power, he polarises the entire
society, and focuses the survivors of the first war on blood status in a way the
generation just before Grindelwald and World War I did not care.  Some authors
call Riddle's rise in the 1960s and 1970s the first war, but in a real sense it
is the second war around blood status in two generations.  Between the two dark
lords, especially considering Riddle apparently killed off entire families and
not just those who fought against him personally, those who resisted him are now
few in number and, coming out of the two wars, no longer sufficient in number to
be as class conscience as their grand parents might have been. Those who are
most strongly traditional but opposed to violence might have survived
Grindelwald, but Riddle would be a harsher reality.  Any support for law and
order at the expense of his power would be ruthlessly quashed, leaving on the
"traditionalist" side only those who also believe Slytherin's blood nonsense to
at least some degree.  

On top of the polarising effect of the wars, there is also two other affects
working to associate class status with blood status.  The idea of blood status
was associated with Slytherin, and thus with Hogwart's Slytherin house.
Students sorted into that house are those who show tendencies towards cunning
and ambition.  Heirs sorted into Slytherin will vocally espouse Slytherin's philosophy as a
matter of house pride.  Their ambitious dorm mates will do so to curry favour
with them, re-enforcing the beliefs.  They will marry for money and power,
re-enforcing these beliefs beyond school with social connections, and creating a
feedback mechanism into the next generation. 

Eventually there are too many of them for one house at Hogwarts.  More than a
quarter of the population strongly supports blood status.  More than a quarter
of the population is associated by marriage or fealty to the Wizengamot Lords
who protect it in the government.  Where will these children be sorted?
Slytherin students despise Gryffindor's house.  The son or daughter of a
Slytherin family, their allies or dependants cannot afford to be sorted into
Gryffindor.  The family members risk being disowned as traitors.  The allies and
dependants risk being cut off and isolated.  They cannot go to Gryffindor.

Hufflepuff house is famous for taking everyone.  While it is the house of
hard work and loyalty, the Sorting Hat tells us that Hufflepuff said "I'll teach
the lot, and treat them just the same."[^20200701-2]  It is safe to say that
Hufflepuff house has always had a disproportionate number of the school's first
generation and second generation students.  A student who is essentially part of
the Slytherin house overflow would not find that thought appealing.  In fact, a
reliance on hard work and justice would repel a student raised to consider
family connections of prime importance the issue of the first generation
students aside.  Given Hufflepuff house no doubt houses both, it is no wonder
that Malfoy would rather leave than be sorted there, and I am sure he is far
from alone in that thought. 

That leaves Ravenclaw.  If you cannot be in Noble Slytherin's house, having a
reputation for scholarship and/or intelligence is not a bad consolation prize.
Look at the patterns we see in the books.  Gryffindors are the good guys, we
just ignore the fact that Pettigrew was a Gryffindor.  Slytherins are the bad
guys, forget the fact that Andromeda Tonks was a Slytherin.  What Ravenclaws and
Hufflepuffs do we see? Both houses are a fairly mixed bag.  We have Hufflepuffs
like Susan Bones or Hannah Abbott on one hand and Zacharias Smith on the other.
We have Ravenclaws who are members of the DA, and others who steal from Luna.
