The British Ministry of Magic classifies things as "Beings", "[[Non-Beings]],"
"[[Animals]]" (magical and non-magical), and "[[Vegitation]]" (magical and
non-magical).[^211111-2]  This last is really an implicet category, as most wizards think
the difference between vegitation and non-vegitation much more clear than a
non-magical scientist would.[^211111-1]

While there are some political considerations in who is officially granted this
status in the magical world, I am going to classify based on sentience.  While
this is somewhat murky, as it is possible to both different kinds of inteligence
and different possible ranges of inteligence and yet still be sentient, it is
the *right* definition.
