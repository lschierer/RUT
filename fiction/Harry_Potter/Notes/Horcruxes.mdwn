## Horcruxes

First of all, I'm not going to even start about what the proper plural is.  I
do not care.  Horcruxes works, and I am going to go with that. 

I am also going to use this page for the general discussion of whatever magic it
was that 1) allowed Riddle to survive hitting [[Harry]] with the killing curse and
2) affects [[Harry]]'s scar regardless of if that magic is actually a horcrux or
not.

[[!toc  startlevel=3]]

### Origin

One place I want to quibble with cannon is on the origin of Horcruxes. Mrs.
Rowling would have Herpo the Foul be essentially the prefigurement of Riddle, an
evil dark wizard who deals with Parseltongue, a basilisk, and a
horcrux.[^20210323-9]  She tries to rescue this a bit by saying in an interview
that others experimented with this before him, but did not
succeed.[^20210323-10]  This might be nice neat foreshadowing for a novel, but I
find it unrealistic and hokey world building; the caveat made in the interview
is too little, too late. 

If Herpo did use a Horcrux, he would have lived somewhere between the 12th and
9th century BC[^20210323-11], which debunks the Chinese origin of the magic put
forth in _[The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic]_.[^20210323-12] The Valley of
the Kings, in Egypt, however, was in use from the 16th to the 11th century
BC.[^20210323-13]  For my purposes the overlap is actually useful. 

DisobedienceWriter wrote a fairly extensive one-shot, _[The Valley of the Kings
Massacre][TVotKM]_, which focused a fair amount on horcruxes.  I dislike the
characterisation of [[Harry]] in this work, but I do like some of the backstory it
posits. He suggests that the Egyptian priest class delved deep in to runic magic
and soul magic, including Horcruxes and "the ancestor of the modern Killing
Curse."[^20210323-14] In my mind both the killing curse and horcruxes are evil,
the first requiring hatred, the second requiring the remorseless killing of an
innocent.  DisobedianceWriter suggests that one could be created with any
killing, I think Rowling's interview comments require something more
gruesome.[^20210323-15] 

Still, despite the parts I dislike, I *do* like the idea that the Egyptian
priests played the ruling class, developed horcruxes, and that, unlike Itsme66's
theory, horcruxes do work.  It keeps me more in line with cannon, but gets rid
of the over convenient root of all evil version of Herpo.  To mesh back in with
cannon, it is my thought that, since Ancient Greece and Egypt had at least some
contact, Herpo stole the magic theory behind horcruxes from the Egyptians. Hence
it being convenient that the two civilisations overlap. 

Several centuries later, Wong Shan-Hao (from Itsme66's work) attempted a
horcrux, but botched the creation, explaining the intact one on display in the
Imperial Museum of Magic.[^20210324-1]  [[Dumbledore]]'s failure to know about and
properly investigate what an intact horcrux is doing in the Imperial Museum is a
testimony to his overall dependence on the prophecy, and failure to act.

### Harry's Scar

Cannon makes it very clear that Mrs. Rowling has gone with 6 horcruxes plus
[[Harry]]'s scar, plus the portion of the soul that floats around for the first 3.x
books and is finally fully resurrected at the end of book four. That is fine,
and her prerogative. When it comes to [[Harry]]'s scar, I think that cannon is a bit
ambiguous, and leaves open some legitimate speculation.  If you include
interviews as part of cannon, then it starts to lean heavily in favour of it
being … complicated.[^20200731-1]

I first read this in [The Thorny Rose 2][TTR213]:
> "But if you know about the Horcruxes, then you will know that they can only be
> destroyed by the most destructive of forces. There is no way Harry could
> survive that," the old wizard pointed out.
>   
> "What’s the matter? Is your hearing going? As I just said; that would be the
> case if Harry was a proper Horcrux, but he isn’t! His body was never prepared
> in the correct manner that Horcrux receptacles are required to be and he
> wasn’t subjected to a Binding Ritual, either. Voldemort’s sliver of soul isn’t
> properly integrated with Harry’s," Ginny yelled in anger.[^20210311-1]
 
However I now know that this theory is more or less exactly what Mrs. Rowling
intended:[^20200731-2] a horcrux has to be intentional, the bit of soul in
[[Harry]]'s scar is not, therefor he is not a true horcrux.  Because he is not a
true horcrux, it cannot take him over the way a real one would.  The pain is the
bit of soul trying to rejoin the rest of Riddle; and the few times we see it
actually influencing [[Harry]] it is because he is, independently, emotionally
vulnerable to it due to feeling things similar to what Riddle would have been
feeling. 

Interestingly she insists that despite the fact that he is not a true horcrux,
he would have had to be destroyed the same way.[^20210323-1] I, like Ginny in
the fanfiction above, disagree on that.  It does not make sense. I prefer the
theory "Anything enchanted can be disenchanted … there are many poor methods to
solve a problem, but usually only one or a small number of elegant
options."[^20210323-2]  Under this theory, few if any researchers have ever
discovered an way to disenchant a Horcrux that does *not* involve destruction of
the object.  Of those who did discover such a way, they either left no records,
left records inaccessible to Dumbledore, or (nearly the same thing) were someone
considered untrustworthy by Dumbledore and thus not consulted. A variation of
this theory is that there are people that Dumbledore trusts (like Bill Weasley)
who had studied such records, but Dumbledore was so paranoid about knowledge of
Horcruxes that he did not ask even people he trusted.[^20210323-3]

Of course all of this assumes that the soul fragment is actually attached to
*[[Harry]]* and not something embedded in his scar.[^20210330-46]  It is very
clear that Mrs. Rowling intends precisely that; works with something in the scar
really fall into the "nonsense" section below.

### Mostly Unsupported Nonsense

Even though the other 6 have no real legitimate room for speculation given what
is in cannon, it would be _fun_ if we did. I will not promise that I will not
ever do so in anything I attempt to write. I really hadn't considered just how
much fun you could have with this until I read offsides' [Long Live The
Queen](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936).  From Chapter 32:

> “I've reviewed the diary," said Croaker, jumping straight in, "along with
> interviewing both the victim Miss Weasley, as well as Mister Potter. Based on
> what I learned, I'm confident that it was not a Horcrux."
> 
> The Chief Wizard let out a small sigh of relief, though he knew it didn't mean
> that Voldemort hadn't actually made one later. "Do you know what it was?" he
> asked.
> 
> "Yes and no," replied Croaker. "I'm pretty sure I know what it did and how it
> worked from the big picture, but not how it was made or many of the details.
> In fact, I've never seen or found anything in my research quite like it. As
> you recall, a Horcrux holds a piece of the soul, which could theoretically be
> used to take over another body. This," he held up the diary, "was almost the
> exact opposite.
> 
> "After checking it for various residual traces, I found no indication that

Imagine the staggering implications of that.  It is the one criticism I have of
that story, that the author _did not_ really explore the can of worms that
section opens up. Basically, what if Riddle really had done experiments,
_plural_ such that neither he nor Dumbledore could know which had prevented him
from truly dying?  The idea is not without cannon support, Riddle implies as
much in the graveyard scene.

> immortality. You know my goal to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it
> appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not

Six essentially identical horcruxes really doesn't constitute a situation where
you would say "one or more of my experiments had worked."  I mean, the idea that
so many authors have that you have to consume a horcrux to resurrect Riddle is
silly and rather insulting. It is hardly an immortality device if it only
preserves you from a single death that is bound to happen at some point
eventually. But if a horcrux can be properly understood as an anchor that need
not be consumed, then while the idea of a 7 part soul might be interesting and
all, the idea of having several totally different types of anchors is really
just *fascinating.*  It would be so easy to do too, let Riddle be enamoured with
the idea of a seven part soul, that does not mean it is possible, let there be
some arithmetical limit he hits before that, so that it is something he tried
for, but ultimately could not do. 

On the opposite side of the spectrum, souls are clearly not really *splitable*
at all.  If the soul was *truly* split, then the horcrux would not anchor you to
this life, the death of one half would simply not affect the other.  That is
probably where the idea that a horcrux gets consumed in a resurrection comes
from, because the author implicitly assumes that there is no wraith to
resurrect. The problem is that Riddle's existence in the first book contradicts
the theory.  The part of his soul that was not in a horcrux did not pass on, but
rather fled, without a body (or container) to the forest in
Albania.[^20210324-4]  

Building on that, given that the soul does not really split, lets force the
death of one segment, by throwing a horcrux through the veil, and let it pull
the other segments through with it.[^20210324-5] The cannon discrepancy from
that work is that the diary horcrux was destroyed by the basilisk fang, so while
the soul parts are not entirely disconnected (and so can be anchors) they are
not entirely connected either (the containers can be de-horcrux-ified if
destroyed).  

I suppose you could speculate on if the *soul fragment* was destroyed with the
diary or not.  It is theoretically possible that instead of dying that soul
fragment was released from the container.  The problem then would be explaining
what is up with [[Harry]]'s scar, since we are told that a soul fragment latched on
to him, instead of rejoining some other soul fragment (or the main soul piece
that was the wraith).
