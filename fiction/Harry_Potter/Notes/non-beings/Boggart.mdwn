[[!meta title="Boggarts"]]

In creating the Boggart, Mrs. Rowling seems to have lifted a word out of Celtic
mythology,[^211021-10] only to then entirely disregard the backstory that
mythology would normally imply.  

### Level of Intelligence

Like the [[Dementor]], this is fairly debatable.  Mrs. Rowling [tells][] us of
several boggarts that have taken on the shape of humans for fairly long
durations.[^211021-11]  What she does not tell us is enough detail to know if
these boggarts could pass a [[!wikipedia Turing Test]].  

### Analysis

Unlike the [[Dementor]]s, there are no obvious inconsistencies with the
boggarts.  That is not to say there are no concerns.  These particular
[[non-beings]] exemplify the problems with the [[balance of power|balance]] more
clearly than, I think, anything else in the books do.  They can become
*anything*, **_including having a reasonably effective facsimile of that
something's magic_** (thus it can become a [[Dementor]]).  Even if it is a
somewhat weakened facsimile, the fact that it can resurrect a suppressed memory
and cause [[Harry]] to faint means that it is still a frighteningly over-powered
creature.
