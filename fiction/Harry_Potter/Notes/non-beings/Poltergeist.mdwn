Poltergeists are perhaps the least objectionable of the [[non-being]]s.  Mrs.
Rowling tells us that they tend to appear wherever "young people, especially
adolescents, are living."[^211022-1]  She has further stated that they are
indestructible[^211022-2] with implied confirmation in that attempts to remove
Peeves have failed.[^211022-3]

That being said, these seem to be more or less morally neutral.  They will
plague anyone for any or no reason, and they seem to have some concept of
affection (see their relationship with the Weasley twins for example).
