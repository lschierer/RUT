[[!meta title="Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA)"]]

Mrs. Rowling would have this established in 1693[^20210228-8] with the primary 
end of enforcing the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, and 
eradicating the "Scourers."[^20210228-9]  These last are apparently a group of
magical users who have somehow become anti-magic, and now hunt other magical
users.[^20210228-10]  There are a couple of problems with this.

1. Perhaps most importantly, the Declaration of Independence was not signed
	 until July of 1776.  The First Continental Congress was in September and
	 October of 1774.  Pick either date you like, but earlier than that especially
	 over fifty years earlier, your average citizen was very much a British
	 subject.  There *was* no "United States of America" for there to be a Magical
	 Congress of, and the very idea would have been ludicrous to any except the
	 most skilled practitioner of divination.  
2. The government and society she describes ignores the fact that this newly
	 established government would have no authority over the Native American
	 tribes.  The histories I see on [WizardingWorld][ww] do not account for any
	 subjugation of the wizards and witches in these populations.  I suspect that
	 you would see few wands among them, but that you *would* see varieties of
	 animagi or at least methods of becoming one, unknown to Europe, as well as a
	 wide variety of potions.  
3. The government and society she describes ignores the Cajun culture, with its
	 voodoo and spiritualism.  In the Harry Potter world, this would be an area
	 where the ISWS is stretched to the limit, and oblivators are running around
	 like crazy.
4. I have seen fanfictions out there that suggest that Disney was either a squib
	 or secretly a wizard.  Either makes a fair amount of sense, much more than a
	 harsh separation between the magical and non-magical world. 
5. Wizards have trouble keeping up with the modern muggle world.  How would an
	 isolationist MACUSA deal with the influx of immigrants that came through
	 Ellis Island, where *12 million* immigrants would enter the US in a mere 62
	 years starting in 1892?[^20210228-11]  It is unbelievable that some first
	 generation wizards, refugees from pure-blood prejudice if nothing else, were
	 not among that number.  They came for the freedom that the non-magical
	 government promises, they would be restless and rebellious if they arrived to
	 find a repressive magical government in place. 

For these and because as an American citizen myself the MACUSA concept is
distasteful, in any fanfiction I write that does for some reason touch upon the
wider world stage, MACUSA will be ignored.  This necessarily means that the
prequel Fantastic Beasts movies will be used as cannon only where convenient.
