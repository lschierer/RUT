### Analysis

From the other references to the class, it appears that this may in fact be a
fairly comprehensive list of things he lectures on, despite the fact scope of
magical history, and despite the very very slight insight into OWL questions we
have.[^20210519-9] While there are a number of times the class is referenced
without a topic being given, there are also a number of times where the same
topic is mentioned even though a fair amount of time should have passed since
the last mention. 

Thus my conclusion is that while the common theme in fanfiction that he only
talks about goblin wars is heavily overstated, Binns is *not* adequately
covering history.  He is not only soporific in tone, he is probably covering his few
topics in minute detail, rather than canvasing the breadth of history across the
five years of having a captive audience.
