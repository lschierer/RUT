#### Dursleys

* Harry's cupboard is full of spiders
* Harry's cupbard is "dark."  [^20190610-4]
* "Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry" [^20190610-2]
* Vernon is not just violent towards Harry: 

  > Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had
  > hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack
  > his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. [^20200513-1]
* What does it mean to be "given a week in the cupboard" given he sleeps there
  nightly anyway?[^20190610-5] Certainly that the door is locked from the
  outside [^20190610-6] at least some of the time, but not all of
  it.[^20190610-6]
* Vernon is not the only one offering potentially severe physical harm to Harry: 

  > Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was
  > in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still
  > had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.
  > Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until
  > he'd finished. [^20200513-2]
* Incarceration like this is illegal now, and probably frowned upon even then: 

  > Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to
  > fit bars on Harry’s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom
  > door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a
  > day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise,
  > he was locked in his room around the clock. [^20200513-3]
* Veron strangles Harry in _the Order of the Phoenix_[^20200513-4]
* Harry has some disturbing habits: 

  > “You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said
  >  Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.” [^20200513-5]

  and then the quote: 

  > Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several
  > steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of
  > arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.[^20200513-6]
* On the other hand "I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing
  a good beating wouldn’t have cured"[^20190610-7] suggests that Harry's abuse has been
  emotional in nature (along with neglect of course) and not physical.

There are also some descriptions of Veron's behavior, particularly in the third chapter of
_the Philosopher's Stone_, that may or may not be Veron talking more aggressively
than he acts, and may or may not be figurative language rather than a litteral
description of how he treats Harry.  Overall there is certainly verbal abuse and
neglect.  By today's standards we'd consider the above list sufficient to tack
on physical abuse as well though.  Harry should not have needed to learn to
_habitually_ stay out of reach for example.  From my reading of other people's
comments on this topic, I have gathered that the standards for what constituted
child abuse were more lax in the 1980s (when Harry was growing up), and even
more so in Britain as compared to the United States, but I have no authoritative
evidence of that, just hearsay.
