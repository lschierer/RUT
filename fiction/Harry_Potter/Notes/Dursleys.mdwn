#### Dursleys

* Harry's cupboard is full of spiders
* Harry's cupbard is "dark."  [^20190610-4]
* "Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry" [^20190610-2]
* On the other hand "I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing
  a good beating wouldn’t have cured"[^20190610-7] suggests that Harry's abuse has been
  emotional in nature (along with neglect of course) and not physical.
* What does it mean to be "given a week in the cupboard" given he sleeps there
  nightly anyway?[^20190610-5] Certainly that the door is locked from the
  outside [^20190610-6] at least some of the time, but not all of
  it.[^20190610-6]
