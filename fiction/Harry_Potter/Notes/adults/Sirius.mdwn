### Speculation

#### Effects of Azkaban

Sirius spent twelve years in Azkaban.  We are told that most prisoners go mad
within weeks, and to drain a wizard of his/her powers.[^20210630-1]  What
effects did this experience have on Sirius?  He believes that he never lost his
mind because the thought of his own innocence was not a happy thought, and
keeping that thought kept him sane,[^20210630-2] and that later, hearing about Peter created
an obsession within him, one that cleared his mind and gave him
strength.[^20210630-3]

A fogged mind and reduced magic for twelve years sounds like, whatever Harry
thinks in at various times in the book, he was in fact affected by the
experience.  This kind of long term trauma *might* have long term effects on his
mental state.  Additionally, we do not know how much wizards depend on their
magic for their overall health.  If his magic was suppressed by his depression,
would that have long term health consequences as well? 

One possibility:
> "He was in desperate need of a mind healer after twelve years in Azkaban and
> another one spent as a dog. … If it was only some psychological trauma he
> could visit from time to time or even find someone in Britain, but
> he suffered brain damage from everything he went through. Dementors are not
> gentle when they pillage through your brain. Sirius needs to take more than a
> dozen potions each day and while I'm a certified healer my knowledge about
> head injuries boils down to detecting them and fetching a mind
> healer."
> 
> "Can we visit?"
> 
> "I am not sure. He'll be unconscious for most of the treatment so he might
> spend the next three months in an induced coma while the potions do their
> magic," the older witch said[^20210630-4]

#### Lack of a trial

Why was Sirius denied a trial?  More, how was it *possible* to deny him a trial?
It is reasonable to accept that [[Lupin]] both believed him guilty and would
have been unable to demand a trial.  Why, however, did none of [[Dumbledore]],
Andromeda Black, or his own blood family demand a trial?

Lets start with the easy ones:  Arcturus, Pollux, and Walburga Black.  We know
that Walburga hated her son, enough to want him disowned.  We further know,
because Sirius inherited number 12 Grimmauld Place, that neither Orion (died
1979) nor Arcturus Black (died 1991) did so.[^20210517-3]  However, we can
infer the following from the fact that they *also* did not disown Bellatrix and
Regulus Black:
* they at very least were not opposed to [[Riddle]]'s pure-blood terrorism
* they probably (given what we know of Walburga at least) supported [[Riddle]]
* they cared more about the survival of the name Black than Sirius' beliefs

My guess is that they held themselves apart from actually joining the Death
Eaters, and thus did not *know* that Sirius had not joined.  They saw his
incarceration thus as being one of two alternatives:
* he is guilty and thus they could at last be somewhat proud of him
* he is innocent and thus continues to be a disgrace.

Given that, I believe they would find the lack of a trial almost palatable, they
would somewhat fear to find out which alternative is true.  If he is in fact
guilty, then when [[Riddle]] returns (which they *probably* expected, the Malfoy
family certainly seems to have expected it) then he would be freed from Azkaban.
If he was innocent, then it is a shame the family name would die out, but better
that no one know their shame (that Sirius is a blood traitor).  

Thus they were essentially betting on the odds that Sirius was both in fact
guilty (and thus the trial would not help him) and that [[Riddle]] would return
before Sirius died, thus giving him (Sirius) an opportunity to
procreate.[^20210517-4]

Why did Andromeda not demand a trial?  My guess is that she falls sufficiently
into the "trust [[Dumbledore]]" category that she believes his testimony about the
betrayal even if the only evidence of her Order membership is the use of her
house as a safe house.[^20210517-5]

What about [[Dumbledore]]?  It really comes down to what did he know when.  Was
anything said in the Potter wills?  We do not know. Did he have any indication,
from [[Snape]] for example, that Pettigrew was in fact the traitor?  Again, we do
not know.  This *might* be simply [[Dumbledore]] not caring to use political capital
to ensure a trial that should not change anything (Sirius if guilty would have
still gone to Azkaban). 

[^20210517-3]: See my notes on the [[History]] page.

[^20210517-4]: Some writers have speculated that long term exposure to dementors
    would affect virility, fertility, or both.   I am unaware of any cannon
    reason to believe this.

#### Sirius as Godparent

Does Sirius recognise that [[Harry]] is not James reincarnated?  Is he an adrenaline
junkie, or can he help [[Harry]] learn to make mature decisions about dangerous
situations?  Is the antagonism with [[Snape]] due to hatred for one whose
loyalty he suspects might in fact be towards [[Riddle]], or is it evidence that he
remains the immature bully he admits he was a youth?[^20210519-11]  In short,
does Sirius deserve the censure that [[Molly]] and [[Hermione]] at times level
upon him?
