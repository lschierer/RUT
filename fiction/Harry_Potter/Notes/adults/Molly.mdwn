## Overview 

Mrs. Rowling has not given us a ton of information on Molly, especially
considering how central she is to the books in general and to the Weasley
family dynamics in particular.  We know that [[Arthur]] was born was born in
February of 1950 and started Hogwarts in 1961.[^20210818-4] We have been told
that Molly's birthday is in October,[^20210818-5] but we do not know
definitively if she was in his year at Hogwarts, or if she was a year younger.
Either way, they married very shortly after graduating, and [[Bill]] was born
soon after that,[^20210818-6] though there is some ambiguity on the exact timing
of these events.  There is room to put her in the year below [[Arthur]], to put [[Bill]]
as being born in 1969, and to thus say that she did not finish her seventh year
at Hogwarts for example, or to put her in [[Arthur]]'s year, [[Bill]] in 1970,
or both, and allow her to finish normally.  

Molly is overprotective, overbearing, controlling, incredibly generous,
incredibly caring, and undoubtedly a tries, as best she understands it, to be a
good person.  That is not to say, as the above list of adjectives shows, to say
she always succeeds, but unlike [[Dumbledore]] I truly believe that Molly's
heart is firmly in the right place.  While she does have the classic red head's
temper, most of her vices are rooted in that she is "one that lov'd not wisely
but too well."[^20210818-7]

I think my biggest objections to Molly are as follows:

* I dislike the way she treats [[Sirius]] when living in his house.
* I dislike the fact that we do not see any sort of birthday acknowledgement for
  the [[Weasley|Families/Weasley]] children, but do see her celebrating [[Harry]]'s in several books.
* I dislike the fact that she ignores [[Ginny]] and the twins when commenting on Ron
  becoming a prefect. 
* I dislike the way she belittles the twin's dream of a joke shop.  I have
  experienced myself the hurt that comes when a parent dismisses your career as
  unimportant.  
* I dislike the way she says that even in books six and seven, Molly will tell
  you that the twins are *children.*  As a parent myself, I get wanting to
  protect your children, but I also understand that you must let them grow up.
  It is a hard thing to do, and must be even harder in a time of war, *but it
  must be done* **for their own good**.  
* I dislike the way she handled Bill and [[Fleur]]'s engagement.  I believe that
  she, like most of the women in the series, is irrational about [[Fleur]].

## Speculations

### After the War

I know of very little canonical information on Molly after [[Harry]] defeats
Riddle. I have read all sorts of speculation about how she might or might not
handle things, so much so that it is effectively impossible to accurately begin
to give credit where credit is due.  My own thoughts on the matter, admittedly
influenced by the various depictions I have read. 

* I do not think that Molly would handle things well.  As much as she might want
  to be a pillar of strength for the family, she has just come face to face with
  her own Bogart.[^20210818-8]  For all that she was able to hold it together
  during the battle, I think she would have been severely affected after. 
  * I do not think that Molly would be inclined to face the reality of Hogwarts
    not being safe.  Neville gave us *some* insight into the horrors of life
    under [[Snape]] and the Carrow twins.[^20210818-10]  I doubt they were only
    abusive to the boys, or only abusive after [[Ginny]] left at Easter.  Molly
    will not want to believe that. After all, she has insisted that [[Harry]],
    [[Ron]] and [[Hermione]] have been safe at Hogwarts for the prior six
    years.[^20210818-11]
  * I suspect that she will be unsympathetic about any complaints [[Ron]] makes
    about the past year.  She will say he should have been in school (see the
    above).  
* I do not think she would have easily accepted [[Ginny]] as getting engaged to
  [[Harry]], particularly not any time before [[Ginny]]'s finishing Hogwarts.  
  * Molly is inclined to deny the reality of her children growing up, and [[Ginny]]
    is her youngest.
  * Molly is inclined to believe the press even when her own experience should
    tell her differently.[^20210818-9]  [[Harry]] will always avoid the press, who
    will always be inclined to make things up about him as a result.  This will
    result in all sorts of false stories about [[Harry]] dating this girl or that
    girl.  These stories will make Molly doubt his commitment to [[Ginny]]. 
  * Molly is inclined to be controlling.  Even if she actually likes the idea,
    the fact that [[Harry]] and [[Ginny]] did this without consulting her will
    make her react negatively. The exception to this would be if [[Harry]]
    somehow avoids falling into the first two bullet points, gets Molly to admit
    to herself that he and [[Ginny]] are dating, *and* asks Molly about
    proposing before asking [[Ginny]].  
* The same objections *probably* do not hold true of a relationship between
  [[Ron]] and [[Hermione]], *assuming* the two of them wait for [[Hermione]] to
  finish school first *and* for Molly to calm down about [[Ron]] not going back
  to school. 
* Initially Molly would have been fairly strongly inclined to continue
  considering [[Harry]] as part of the [[Weasley|Families/Weasley]] family after the war.  If,
  however, my thoughts on a [[Harry]]/[[Ginny]] relationship are accurate, then,
  I suspect that even if they do not "rush things," Molly will cool off on her
  support for [[Harry]] and will be quite happy about him moving out.  I am
  unsure if she would go so far as to encourage it or not though.  If they do
  "rush things" she definitely would kick him out in a fit of temper, even if
  she does regret doing so later. 
* We are told that [[Ginny]] played Quidditch professionally after finishing
  school.  I doubt Molly approved.  I strongly suspect that she considers girls
  playing Quidditch to be unlady-like.
