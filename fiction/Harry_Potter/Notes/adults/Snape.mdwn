One of Mrs. Rowling great themes across the [[Harry]] Potter series is the
redeeming power of love.  She is absolutely right to consider love one of the
most powerful forces in existence, and one of the most magical.  As she is
writing for children, I cannot fault her wanting to make the world more nearly
black and white, with good guys and bad guys.  In such a world, Snape, being
one of the good guys, must be redeemed.  [[Harry]], being even more clearly one
of the good guys, must not only be part of his redemption, but must recognise
and champion it.  This gives us the epilogue, with a child of [[Harry]]'s named
Albus Severus, the two characters that Mrs. Rowling most wants the reader to
forgive.

The books are, however, not *really* children's books at all.  I disagree with
classifying the latter books as such, and am restricting my own children's
reading of them, keeping them at one book a year starting from when they turn
eight. The first few books are fine; while there are some troubling things in
them, it will largely go over a child's head with little risk of influence
or damage.  However, as one advances through the books, there is more that
requires mature judgement, because more and more, the characters are making
decisions, and in the case of the adults, revealing past decisions, that
require the reader to recognise that good people can make bad choices, and,
yes, bad people can make good choices.

Severus Snape is a very grey character.  He, like most children, starts
out fallen, but essentially unformed.  He comes from an abusive back-
ground,[^20200806-1] and apparently has very little of [[Harry]]'s
extraordinary resilience.  As such, he is damaged.  He is given no help to
recover from this damage. We have no true picture of what [[Hogwarts]] looked
like while the Marauders, Lily and Severus were there, but that much we can
be fairly certain of.  We know that some of the Slytherins students are either
openly Death Eaters, or are openly vying to become Death Eaters.[^20200806-2]
We know that at least one female student was assaulted in an unknown way by
[[dark magic|Magic]], that Snape calls it funny, and Lily calls it evidence
of Mulciber being "creepy."[^20200806-3] I could go on, but you can see that
already, [[McGonagall]] and [[Dumbledore]] are allowing not just pranks, but
actual evil to go unpunished.  In such an environment, the needs of victims are
not going to be addressed.

As I said, we know little of Snape at school, but his memories from _the
Deathly Hallows_ have a few things that are possibly suggestive.  In one scene
Lily reacts strongly when Snape uses the phrase "I won't let you" in reference
to her understanding of, or possibly her relationship (or lack there of)
with [[James_Potter]].[^20210106-1] A scene later we have the incident where he
calls her a mudblood and she ends their friendship.  Next we see her refusal to
forgive him, apparently because she does not believe his protestations. Unlike
[[Dumbledore]], Lily wants repentance to be accompanied by evidence of reform.
Some writers have speculated that Lily was seeing parallels between Severus'
behaviour and his father's.[^20210106-2]

Coming out of [[Hogwarts]], Snape joins the Death Eaters, while continuing
his studies in potions.  We do not know what the balance of his time is, we
do not know what atrocities he participated in.  We do know that he gets the
dark mark, we do not know if he had it prior to hearing the prophesy fragment
or not.  Was it a reward, or did he earn the mark in some other way? That
answer could significantly change your view of how much evil Snape has done by
commission versus omission during this phase of his life.

[[Dumbledore]]'s view is that becoming a spy balances the scales.  Snape needs
no punishment for his actions prior to hearing the prophesy.  I cannot agree.
He may have earned some clemency, but not full clemency, and not without a
true trial.  [[Dumbledore]] is not God.

Returning to the memories that Snape would show Harry,[^20210106-3] Snape
says "he thinks it means Lily Evans!" - a curious statement considering that
Lily has in fact been Lily Potter for some time.[^20210106-4] It is in fact
*because* she is Lily Potter that Riddle would be after her and her son. Snape
is showing evidence of denial about the strength of the attachment between
Lily and [[James|James_Potter]], and a failure to understand what love really
means. This is confirmed when he admits that he thought it would work to trade
Lily's life by sacrificing Harry's.  Riddle might well have been willing to go
along with that, but it is not just a quirk of cannon that Lily was not.  We
know that Tobias Snape was abusive, and that Eileen Snape failed to protect
Severus, but I know of no evidence that Eileen did not love her son.  Some
abused women fail to protect their children because they are unable to, not
because they are unwilling to do so; we do not know which category Eileen Snape
falls into. This flaw in understanding is not solely attributable to his
upbringing.

Regardless, Snape is now, supposedly, a spy for [[Dumbledore]].  How much
does he know?  Does he know that Pettigrew is a Death Eater?  Does he know
this before Riddle goes to Godric's Hallow?  What precisely does Snape report
to [[Dumbledore]] during the 19 months or so between the prophesy stating
that [[Harry]] *will* be born, and Halloween of 1981?  The answers to these
questions also play a critical part in assessing Severus Snape, and yet are
unanswered.

Snape becomes a teacher in the fall of either 1982, replacing
Slughorn.[^20210523-1]  It is really really hard to form an objective
understanding of Snape as a teacher.  Most of the time we see his class, he puts
directions on the board and expects the students to brew a potion without help,
while he stalks the room criticising those he dislikes (most of them).  I have
not end-to-end read the series in a few years now, and I cannot find with spot
checking the books any examples of him doing anything else.  I have this vague
memory, however, of at least one example of a lecture in potions class.  Is he a
poor teacher because he does not know how to be better, because he has been
ordered to teach poorly by Riddle, or because he has been ordered to teach
poorly by [[Dumbledore]] as part of maintaining his cover?  If it is because he
does not know how to teach better, do either [[Dumbledore]] or [[McGonagall]]
offer to mentor him, or is he left to flounder on his own? It is necessary to
know the answer to these questions, because his subject is critical to several
really important career paths when you are considering society's ability to
resist Riddle or any other future dark lord. It is especially critical to know
the answer to these questions when Mrs. Rowling states in an interview that
[[Dumbledore]] thinks that dealing with horrible teachers is part of teaching
his students about life.[^20210412-6]

Irregardless of if he does ever actually teach, his behaviour during these
"lab" classes is unacceptable.  The labs are unsafe, and his treatment of the
students unprofessional.  I suspect, however, that it would be _legal_ in,
say, 1800s England, and as the wizarding world seems to have frozen at least
a century ago, Snape is probably not doing anything punishable, just something
reprehensible.

His behaviour as Head of House is something else.  Again, it is not something
that the DMLE could take exception to, except in that if he had had a trial,
and if he were on probation, this would probably violate, or at least call
into question, the terms of that probation.  Snape is very much furthering
the atmosphere that he himself experienced as a student.  How much of this
is because he is allowed to, and how much is because he is instructed to?
[[Dumbledore]] is never seen to use his power as Chief of the Wizengamot or
Supreme Mugwump (I refuse to believe these are powerless).  How much of Snape's
behaviour in the school is part of [[Dumbledore]]'s plans for setting up the
final confrontation when Riddle returns?  We do not know.  We do have clues,
[[Dumbledore]] does seem to, extremely gently, remonstrate Snape about his
views of [[Harry]].  This *suggests* that [[Dumbledore]] is permissive,
not legislative about Snape.  I think that [[Dumbledore]] wants them all,
Snape included, to turn away from these acts spontaneously inspired purely by
example, without any influence of punishment.

Snape, as Head of House, is acting in loco parentis, I think, even more than
the Headmaster does.  It is his responsibility to help form his students; his
failure to punish them is neglect.  His covering for them is teaching them to
disregard moral standards.  His behaviour implicitly and sometimes explicitly
rewards bad behaviour.  This is a problem.

Snape's behaviour during [[Harry]]'s third year, and particularly during the
confrontation in the Shrieking Shack, is enlightening.  He enters the scene
"full of suppressed triumph"[^20210510-3], proceeds to look
fanatical[^20210510-4], and continues on in both book description and in
objective assessment of his behaviour, to be "deranged."[^20210510-5]  He is, in
this encounter, motivated by three things.  One, Snape both fears and hates
werewolves, no doubt stemming from his teen-aged encounter with Lupin.  Two, Snape
has a rational hatred of [[Sirius]] Black taken to an irrational degree. With that
Snape has an inability to separate [[Sirius]] from [[James_Potter]], and
[[James_Potter]] from [[Harry]] Potter.  In Snape's mind anything done by one is
effectively done by all three.  Third, Snape has an incredible desire for fame
and recognition. I think this sequence, as Snape yells at [[Harry]], looking for
him to thank him "on bended knee"[^20210510-6], and then later, with Fudge
talking about the Order of Merlin, gives us a huge insight into Snape's
character.[^20210523-2]  

As Riddle returns, what does Snape know about his activities?  What could
he have told [[Dumbledore]] but chooses to hold back?  What does he tell
[[Dumbledore]] publicly (at least in front of other Order members) versus
what he shares in private alone?  What does [[Dumbledore]] know (from Snape's
reports) but refuse to act on?  We do not know the answer to these questions;
we cannot assess Snape as a spy.  Knowing these answers is important to know if
he was ever truly redeemed, or if he was putting on a show for [[Dumbledore]].
Ultimately, knowing these answers is also important to assess *[[Dumbledore]]*
- for while he faced the classic problem of when to act on knowledge gained
from a spy, his inaction cannot be wholly excused.

Snape becomes Headmaster during what would have been [[Harry]]'s seventh year.
We get only a few glimpses of his tenure.  We know that he catches [[Ginny]]
attempting to steal the sword for [[Harry]], he must have had access to her
unprotected mind, but he assigns her detention with *Hagrid.* [[Harry]] is
right, [[Ron]] is wrong; that was not intended as a serious detention.  How much
worse would [[Hogwarts]] have been had a different Death Eater been Headmaster?
How much could Snape have done to curb problems that he did not do?  We cannot
know.  We know he helped some at least.

Snape is trying to reach [[Harry]] when Riddle decides [[Harry]] must die.  He
(Snape) uses his the last of his strength to give [[Harry]] memories necessary
for [[Harry]] to finally have a true understanding of the situation.  At least
some of this is because Snape is committed to following [[Dumbledore]]'s plans.
The extra memories of Snape's life are, in my opinion, necessary if [[Harry]]
is to believe the final, critical memories of Snape's interactions with
[[Dumbledore]].  The extra memories are not, I think, *entirely* altruistic
however.  Remember what we saw from book 3; Snape is driven beyond reason by the
twin desires of hatred for [[Harry]]'s father, and desire for recognition.  This
is Snape's moment for both.  [[Harry]] *must* believe him, for if [[Harry]] does
not, then Snape will die a death eater.  If [[Harry]] believes, then Snape dies
a hero.  This is critical not only in a moral sense, but for Snape's self image.
*[[Harry]] must think well of Snape or no one will;* and nothing could be more
important to Snape, *except,* perhaps, that [[James_Potter]]'s son might suffer
more.  These memories can achieve both. If Lily's son must die, then Snape was
going to get everything he could out of it. I think his motivation was thus
complex.

For Snape *is* a complex character.  He was not irredeemable, and even though he
is fictional, there are enough questions about his life that I cannot judge him.
I can say that were I [[Harry]], I would never have named a child after him.  I
hope I would forgive him, but I cannot honour him.  He could have been so much
greater than he was.

On a side note, it is widely speculated that Snape is Draco's godfather.  [This][lc1]
article does not specifically talk about that, but covers the available evidence
as if it were.[^20210517-6]

[^20210523-2]: On a side note, how much of Fudge's distrust of Harry is based on
    this episode, and how much is based on Rita Skeeter's articles across the
    tournament?  Were Rita's articles in part possible *because* of this
    encounter?  She is nasty and vindictive enough to go for Harry on her own,
    but perhaps she had heard rumours of Harry having been confounded?  Magical
    Britain does seem like the sort of society that would blame a victim of such
    an attack.
