### Speculation

#### Personality

In the movie, [[Lupin]] describes Lily has someone who sees the best in people, and
gives them a chance.  This has to be reconciled with the girl who would barely
listen to [[Snape]]'s fumbling attempt at an apology after the incident by the
lake in fifth year.  Has she been forgiving him for years, or has she been
wilfully blind to his faults, and how her eyes are open?  My own thoughts is
that Lily has been wilfully blind, not forgiving.  If this is true, then she
comes across as someone who can hold quite the *unforgiving* line.  That is not
to say I think [[Snape]] necessary deserved forgiveness at that moment, but
rather to emphasise that her character in this scene seems rather contrary to
the movie's depiction of her.  

Along the same lines, the portrayal of her in _[I'm Where][GAFRIW1]_ resonates
with me.  Harry calls her out for being blinded by prejudice,[^20210927-4]
effectively, someone who forms a first impression of someone and refuses to
reevaluate it despite contrary evidence.  *This* view seems to fit the *truly
tiny* amount we know of her from the books much more than [[Lupin]]'s movie
quote, which I am inclined to dismiss as the movie's overall tendency to lionise
the females in the series at the expense of the males.[^20210927-2]
