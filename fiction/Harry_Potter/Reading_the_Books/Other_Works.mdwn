Works Cited

Mrs. J. K. Rowling.  _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ American Digital
Edition first published in 2012.  The American edition was used even though I
prefer the British Additions because it is really difficult to get an electronic
copy of the British edition in the United States.
