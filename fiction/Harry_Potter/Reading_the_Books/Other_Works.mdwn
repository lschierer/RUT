Works Cited

Mrs. J. K. Rowling.  _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ American Digital
Edition first published in 2012.  The American edition was used even though I
prefer the British Additions because it is really difficult to get an electronic
copy of the British edition in the United States.

This one was actually the inspiration for me thinking that Harry should get help
from Hogwarts itself.
