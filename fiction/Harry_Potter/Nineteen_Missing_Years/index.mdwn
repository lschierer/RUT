[[!meta title="Nineteen Missing Years, "]]

What happens between the end of Mrs. Rowling's "Chapter 36 - The Flaw in the
Plan" and the Epilogue?  This question has filled countless hours for dozens if
not hundreds of fan fiction authors, and even more time for fans who are either
not up for the challenge of authoring fan fiction, nor (for any of many possible
reasons) not inclined to do so.  Mrs. Rowling has filled in some of the gaps
with random statements in her various interviews, in her [twitter][]
[feed][jkrtf], [Pottermore][]/[WizardingWorld][], and similar secondary sources.
Some of these match what we know from the books, some of them conflict with
either the books, each other, or both.  

Then there is [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child][HPCC], which presents itself
as being the eighth story in the series, coming after the Epilogue but due to
time travel affecting events throughout the series.  I started reading it, but
it violated my willingness to suspend disbelief by going places with the
characters I was unwilling to go, and thus I have never finished it.  Despite
the fact that Mrs. Rowling is listed as an author, I have seen it compared to a
work of fan fiction,[^211028-1] a view that from what I know of the book/play I
have a great deal of sympathy with.  So much so, that I almost entirely ignore
its existence when I speculate about the universe in my
[[Notes|Harry_Potter/Notes]].  

That aside, what *did* happen in the missing nineteen years?  Since I accept
everything out there as a *secondary* source *at best*, this entire section
represents my opinions and speculations.  It is something less than a fan
fiction, but more open to me filling in the gaps than I am in the
[[Notes|Harry_Potter/Notes]].
