"[Killer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#dino 'turned vegetarian'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4512487.stm)" is interesting primarily because it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exposes the preconceptions of the materialist scientist. He does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not know what this beast eats, he does not know where it came\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from, or what it gave birth to. Yet he is utterly confident of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#his evolutionary explanation. What this does not mention, what I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would find interesting is how they think this beast relates in time\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and evolution to the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Oh, and this mentions the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#frequency of mass "graves" of dinosaur. Naturally this could not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have *anything* to do with a flood.
