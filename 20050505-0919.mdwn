<p> "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4512487.stm">Killer
dino 'turned vegetarian'</a>" is interesting primarily because it
exposes the preconceptions of the materialist scientist.  He does
not know what this beast eats, he does not know where it came
from, or what it gave birth to.  Yet he is utterly confident of
his evolutionary explanation.  What this does not mention, what I
would find interesting is how they think this beast relates in time
and evolution to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Oh, and this mentions the
frequency of mass "graves" of dinosaur.  Naturally this could not
have <em>anything</em> to do with a flood.</p>
