#+TITLE: Mr. Blue

I have finished *Mr. Blue*,^[1]^ recommended by and borrowed from Vincas. I can see why he likes it. But I do not think I shall read it again. Blue is indeed an intriguing fellow, the sort of character that our modern world no doubt needs more of, and is , with even less doubt, ill equipped to understand. The end of the book casts a shadow over its entirety though, one that *I* am ill equipped to handle. It is much like Mr. Ray Bradbury's short stories: I am glad to have them, but I can handle them only in small and infrequent doses.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
