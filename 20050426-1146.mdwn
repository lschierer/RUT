Paul Greenberg [gets](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/paulgreenberg/pg20050425.shtml)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just about everything wrong. He strongly implies that Pope John Paul\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#II was not in charge towards the end of his pontificate, as he grew\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more and more frail. Apparently Mr. Greenberg does not credit the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reports to the contrary, or the prolific output our Holy Father had\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in his final months. Just look at the Vatican's online archives. [7\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Pontifical Messages](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/pont_messages/2005/index_en.htm), [4\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#speeches to different bodies](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2005/index_en.htm), [14\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Letters](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2005/index_en.htm) and [6\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#audiences](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/2005/index_en.htm) are up for reading. Sure, he wasn't able to read his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#own speech much of the time, but that is Parkinson's Disease for you.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The evidence is firmly in support of the control and authority Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#John Paul II continued to exercise right up to his final days.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Mr. Greenberg thinks that Pope Benedict XVI will not reach out.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Our new Holy Father has barely even started his pontificate,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and already, in his homilies, he is reaching out in ways even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the New York Times has noticed (reference previous posts here).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Greenberg suggests we are entering a "holding pattern," while\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Pope is talking about attempting to revive the faith world wide.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Greenberg thinks that this Pope is too old, while the youth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even before his election cheered him, stood in the rain to meet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with him (I have lost the reference for this statement â˜¹).

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
And lastly, Mr. Greenberg thinks that in recent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decades the Church has been "the health of freedom, of the West, of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learning and of tolerance, all of which a renewed church championed."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I can only ask where he has been? Certainly not Earth. The Church\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has not tolerated the push for the acceptance of depravity and death.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The Church changed no doctrine, and angered many who hoped to use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Vatican II as an excuse to introduce the Modernist heresy into\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Church. Further, looking here at the United States alone, we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have seen slower growth, growth mostly from immigration in fact.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We have seen those who claim to be Catholic in open opposition\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the Church's teaching. How is that "health" Mr. Greenberg?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Unless you actually *want* to see the Church flounder.
