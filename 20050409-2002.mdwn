So Vincas thinks that [these](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1366327/posts)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[two](http://sln.fi.edu/inquirer/mummy.html) articles are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#note worthy. My reaction to them was rather less than he expected\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think; they do not surprise me. It does not surprise me that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these did not make the news until now. It does not surprise me that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they are not big news now, the way, for example, a new old partial\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#skeleton would be. It does not surprise me that they are there.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We know James went to India, and Matthew evangelized Ethiopia.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Do you really thing they stopped there? That they went no further?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Well, perhaps, but personally, I think each, except Peter who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#settled his see in Rome, continued until death, imprisonment,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or age prevented further travel. Further, Alexander the Great\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#made it as far as India as well, so we *know* that, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the technology available at the time, long distance conquest and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#governance were possible. If they are possible, travel and trade\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are as well, and the common sense assumption is that where trade is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#possible, someone will find a way to make it profitable. Plus, even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with the expense of travel, the silks and spices from the far east\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were enough to make Italy rich in the middle ages and renaissance,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#why would not not be profitable for those in the early centuries?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Technology was not that much less when it came to travel, wagons\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are pretty much wagons after all.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Why does it not surprise me that it has not been noticed and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is not making big news now? History and anthropology do not work\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that way. Both are firmly committed to the idea that human progress\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has been more or less linear, and to allow this sort of travel would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#undermine that. Both are more than willing to ignore evidence.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Have you looked at roman roads? Cobble stone though they are,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ours do not last half so long. Have you looked at their glass?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Except that it is dirty, I doubt anyone short of an expert could tell\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it from the bubbly glass that the colonists made in Williamsburg.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They had make-up rather similar to ours, and the greek fire is still\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more or less a mystery. Further back in antiquity we have even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less records, and thus more room for speculation, and speculate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we do. Do you really think these speculations are unaffected by\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our theories? Seriously?
