#+TITLE: Carbon Dioxide is like cigarettes?

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> But Myles Allen, a lecturer on atmospheric physics at Oxford University, said assessing a "safe level" of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was "a bit like asking a doctor what's a safe number of cigarettes to smoke per day".^[[1]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4660938.stm\ "Stark\ warning\ over\ climate\ change")^

I wonder if the good professor is aware that we need at least some carbon dioxide, but we do not need any cigarettes.
