\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Jeb Bush fought amazingly (for a politician) to save\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Mrs. Schivao's life, so I suppose I should not be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# *too* upset that his administration is giving\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# up the fight to block a 13 year old who is a ward of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# the state from having an abortion. But I am. Details are [here](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/d960000c8fbbc8f6.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# and [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4510847.stm).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Governor Bush, in his press release, is absolutely correct, there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# is simply no good news at all related to this case. Its not good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# news that she became pregnant, it is not good news that she is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# getting an abortion.
