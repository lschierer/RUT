So [here](http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2004/gut.htm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is an interesting article, "It's the gut, stupid!" from *Infection\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#& Immunity*: 73(1), January 2005. Researchers reporting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in this article have linked allergies to oddness in the bacteria\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#content of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Apparently taking lots\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of antibiotics will wipe out your normal bacteria. And apparently a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#somewhat different mix is what grows back, at least for a short time.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#As I have pointed out in the past, the appendix, possibly along with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other parts of the GI tract, is responsible for exposing the immune\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#system to foreign material, to help "teach" it what is harmful.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So with your GI tract all weirded out by the antibiotics, they can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#make mice far more likely to develop allergies. This is interesting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on a personal note because I was taking enough anti-biotics as a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#child, due to frequent (approximately one a month) sinus infections,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to become immune to some of them. Perhaps this is why I'm allergic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to dust, dogs, and pollen? It boggles the mind.
