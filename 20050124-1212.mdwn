I think I have this all set up for now. No RSS, but that's fine with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#me, if you've managed to find this, you are already coming here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#periodically already. Maybe I'll do that later. It would be an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interesting exercise in php's xml capabilities to see if I can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#generate something fairly compliant on the fly.
