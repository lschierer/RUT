Still, as it develops, some of the other applications, such as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#helping people learn to dance, or interacting with other people,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or even interacting with a guard dog, are interesting. It will be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interesting to see this area of research develop.
