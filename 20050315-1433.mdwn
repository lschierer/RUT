So I've been mostly silent here since Thursday last week.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#My weekend was spent largely away from the computer, as is often\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the case, lost in my own thoughts and reading. I read all of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Terry Goodkind's *Chainfire* and most of *The Phantom\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the Opera* (yes, the real book, not a novelization of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#opera or movie). I also went to see PVI's production of "Bye,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Bye Birdie" with the family and Lauren. It was very well done,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#very enjoyable. *Chainfire* was somewhat dissatisfying.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#While it did somewhat depart from his earlier habit of lecturing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#instead of advancing the story, it did not completely do so (which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I suppose would be too much to ask, but would be nice considering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the first couple books of the series). My real gripe however is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the incomplete way in which it ended. It is very anti-climactic.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Rather than a resolution, it merely achieves a recognition of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the problem it presents and introduces. Hopefully the next in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the series will be better. *The Phantom of the Opera*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is more â€¦ complete than the movie or opera is. Naturally,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or at least "naturally" in the sense that Hollywood always does so,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Andrew Loyd Weber saw fit, in creating first his opera and then his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#movie, to edit and redact the novel, simplifying the plot line.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#One thing that does improve with the movie is a more successful\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#portrayal of the author's attempt to act as a historian rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than a novelist. In the movie especially you get the sense of a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#flashback to real events, real history, real mystery, in the book,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is not carried off anywhere near so well. He refers to letters\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and interviews as the source of his story, but knows too much of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the characters' motivations, emotions, and thoughts for that to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be an accurate explanation. He references Christine's letters,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some police reports, interviews with some of the other characters,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yet in places he knows of things that the vicomte alone should have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#known, the one person he does *not* list as a reference.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, it is a very good read, and I do not regret purchasing it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Far from it, for, as I said, that flaw aside, it is in may ways a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more complete, well rounded story than the movie presents, and thus,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in its way, more satisfying.

So much for my reading. An equally large reason for my absence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from this one-voiced forum is the perplexing nfs problem I've\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been hitting. From all I understand, `/etc/exports`\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*should* be able to handle both notation in the form of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#192.168.50.0/24 and 192.168.50/255.255.255.0. However, after 2\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#days of blaming the kernel or the bproc configuration, we have,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more or less accidentally, discovered that only the former works.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Complicating the issue, both 192.168.50.0/255.255.255.0 and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#192.168.50.\* notations will work *in some situations, most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#notably where a reverse look-up****fails***.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is the times where things ***work*** that it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is ***more strict***. This seems incredibly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#counter-intuitive to me, and was the cause of the delay in my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#discovering the true cause of the problem. You see, the host in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#question was serving nfs mounts on two interfaces, and the other\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interface, denoted with the same /255.255.255.0 type notation,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*was working*. So naturally I did not think to suspect\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the identical (except for the specific IP range of the network)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#notation for the other network. Still, at least the problem was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#discovered and is now fixed.
