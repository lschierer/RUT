[...] Just as I was concerned to see a New Mexico church banned from the sacramental use of a hallucinogenic tea,[2] not because I support the use of hallucinogens, but because I see the parallels between this and prohibition, I am concerned about this action in Britain. Recall that in Canada,[3] Sweden,[4] and Australia (though I cannot find the reference for that one) all have laws on the books that would potentially classify any priest who gives a homily declaring homosexuality to be wrong as &#8220;fomenting extremism&#8221; (though of a different type), and thus put his parish at risk of being forcibly closed.[5] Though the application of this new United Kingdom law may for now be limited to the closing of mosques that promote terrorism, using the law in this way will create legitimizing precedent should the state (of Britain) ever choose to target Catholics (again). For this reason, this law is to be feared.

The sites I have found state that religious speech is exempted in the Canadian bill. [...]
