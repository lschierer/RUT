Score one to those who are fighting for life at all its stages; "[Signs\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Awareness Seen in Brain-Injured Patients](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/science/08coma.html?ei=5088&en=fad9f8f8470414a6&ex=1265605200&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=)" by Benedict Carey\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#documents a study that discovers that some unresponsive patients\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#might in fact not be brain dead, but be aware and unable to respond.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This stands to reason, it is logically entirely possible to loose the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ability to control muscles without loosing the ability to receive\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#input, as the "[Exercise Your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Wonder](http://www.arn.org/eyw.htm)" column on [ARN](www.arn.org) has documented,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the nerves involved with control and sensation are different,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and brain mapping studies have shown much the same, though they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do not really understand *what* is going on, they can tell\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*where* the unknown is taking place. This should have an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interesting effect on cases like that one in Florida where the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#parents of a paralyzed woman are fighting to keep her alive over\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the objections of her lowlife husband.
