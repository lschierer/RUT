#+TITLE: The Assumption Vigil Mass

I went to Mass last night for the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Vigil. I do not think I have attended on the vigil for this holy day before, because I was surprised to see the Gospel reading, not because it does not fit — it does, but because it fits so very well.[\^200708151] \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> While Jesus was speaking,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a woman from the crowd called out and said to him,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#“Blessed is the womb that carried you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the breasts at which you nursed.”\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He replied,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#“Rather, blessed are those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who hear the word of God and observe it.”[\^200708152]

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#A Protestant might see this and think "See, Mary is not so special." Such a Protestant would have missed something crucial. Here, Jesus is pointing out that what makes Mary so special is not the simple fact that she is his mother, but the unique and absolute nature of her "Yes" to God. For who besides Christ Himself has heard the word of God and observed it with the fidelity that Mary has? \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200708151]: [Lk 11:27-28](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/luke/luke11.htm\#v27)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200708152]: Ibid.
