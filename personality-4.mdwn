**PURITY: 90% sex, 95% substance, 79% moral [****88% total**]
**Well done!** The higher your scores, the more "pure" you are. The lower, the more you've experienced.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This test was about done deeds, so your numbers will never climb. [It's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interesting to think they all started at 100%.] But will your purity\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#continue to fall? Will you **OUTGROW** or will you **OUTDO** your past experiences? It's up to you.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Don't **date** anyone if your **moral** purities differ by more than **30%**.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Don't **run a business** with anyone if your **substance** purities differ by more than **40%**. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Do **be friends** with someone who has less than 1/2 your **sex** purity. You'll enjoy their colorful company.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
