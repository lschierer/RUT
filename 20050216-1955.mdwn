The South Dakota "[House\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#panel approves measure to make abortion a felony"](http://www.aberdeennews.com/mld/aberdeennews/news/10877880.htm)"!! This is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#awesome news!!\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> The State Affairs Committee unanimously approved HB1249,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which would make it a felony to do abortions if Roe v. Wade, the 1973\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, is overturned. The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bill would allow exceptions in cases where a pregnant woman's life\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is at risk.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Hopefully the full state house, the state senate, and the Governor\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of South Dakota will stand up to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and pass this as well.
