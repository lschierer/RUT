#+TITLE: Inteligent Design in kangaroo court

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
I recall from the previous Microsoft trial (the Department of Justice one a few years ago) that it is rather hard to overturn a judge's Findings of Fact. The recent Dover trial makes me regret that. If Mr. West is accurate, then the Judge in that trial badly misrepresented the arguments made in favor of intelligent design, but instead created a straw man and/or red herring argument to debunk and discredit instead.^[[1]](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/dover_in_review_an_analysis_of_1.html\ "An\ Analysis\ of\ Judge\ Jones'\ Flawed\ Ruling\ in\ Kitzmiller\ v.\ Dover\ Area\ School\ District")^ This write-up really makes it sound like Judge Jones had his mind made up before the trial started, a real tragedy.
