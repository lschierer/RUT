Slavery is thriving even in Britain, as Police there find that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hundreds of children, mostly black children, are vanishing from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the schools each year.[1] Naturally Britain, socialist state that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is, is looking to solutions such as attempting to register each\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and every child and tracking them to try to solve the problem.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But I think and fear that it can only truly be solved by a return\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of morality to the forefront of every day life. Interestingly,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when I first read Mr. Belloc's essays, I dismissed this one as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a prediction that he had gotten wrong. Later, I rethought it in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#terms of the similarities between slavery as it was and the debt\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#system we have now. Now I am seeing that this is not just a problem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the third world, but even in a first world (declining, highly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#technical population) country like Britain. As police fail to curb\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this, I wonder if we *will* see this become more socially\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accepted in Europe. If so, it is only a matter of time before it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#migrates across the border to our own country, if it has not already\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(Sweat shops with immigrants working in them anyone?).
