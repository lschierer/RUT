Michelle Malkin's "[How\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Effective Are Flu Shots?](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001520.htm)" links to "[Impact\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Influenza Vaccination on Seasonal Mortality in the US\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Elderly Population](http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/165/3/265)" from the Archives of Internal Medicine.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#She also links to a Los Angeles Times story, but I did not feel\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like registering there to read it. The upshot of all these is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more confirmation of my overall impression that flu shots aren't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#worth much.
