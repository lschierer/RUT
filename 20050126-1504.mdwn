I've more or less been slowly writing this all day today,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though the size of it does not reflect that. \*shrugs\*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ah-well.  
 **news**  
 There is a man in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Florida who has some incredible guts, whatever his other faults. [This\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#story](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/features/1120/1-26-2005/20050126053003_40.html) talks about a man who full-page newspaper ad in an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#attempt to contact his wife and save his Marriage. Whatever\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#his faults, I think it must have taken great courage to use so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#public a method to reach her. I hope things work out.  
 In\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Delaware, a "life" sentence now means 45 years[^1^](#findlaw1). Lovely. People argue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against the death penalty saying that in the modern era, it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#possible to keep society safe without it. I tend to agree, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#things like this make me wonder if that is true.  
 The BBC [reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/4208479.stm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that birth rates are falling world wide. The tone of the article\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seems to oscillate between sorrow that they are not falling faster\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and worry that they are falling. How confused a world we live in,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when the fact that we can't sustain population levels isn't a cause\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for concern, a wake-up call that something is wrong with society.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Our faith tells us that we are called to "multiply", I do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#think God intended that to mean "by fractions". At some point\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we are going to have to realize that motherhood is important,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that having and raising children is the most important, most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#meaningful thing that a couple will, or could, ever do. I don't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#know how to argue this one effectively. I know that it is true,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but how do seriously tell a girl that you don't think a career\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#outside the home is the best course she can take, the best she\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can aspire to? For all its truth, how do you make that truth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#shine through?

**gaim**  
 I hate it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when users get ideas about how easy something is to implement.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I hate it even more when they think they can dictate priorities.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Why can people not grasp that in an open source project, only the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#developers' priorities matter?
