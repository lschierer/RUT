#+TITLE: Weekend Wrapup

Overall a very good weekend. The family made it up (and down) safely, and is or has headed back, equally safely. Papa was uber surprised when he arrived at Maggiano's and found a birthday party in place of a graduation party. We had 50 people there, including a number of people he has not seen in a great many years. Michael's graduation also went well, despite the rain. As per his request, we had a barbecue, moving the grill into the garage, but otherwise going more or less as planned. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#On the downside, Lauren missed much of the weekend's activities, not feeling well. â˜¹
