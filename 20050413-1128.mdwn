Diana West's article, "[Reviewing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the National Review](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/dianawest/dw20050411.shtml)," got me going on what is otherwise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a very slow week for news. She documents a couple cases of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anti-christian activism, one of which I recall hearing about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but overlooked, and one of which is new to me. Apparently,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is vilification, and thus illegal, for a non-Muslim to read\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Koran aloud, or at least certain sections of it that deal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with women. Who would have guessed? This rather outrageous idea\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was used to prosecute 2 pastors who decided to give a sermon on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Islam, hardly surprising in these days where it is dominating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the news. Secondly, the Council on American Islamic Relations\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(CAIR) is up in arms about two books that the National Review\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is selling. *[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Life and Religion of Mohammed](http://www.thbookservice.com/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6614)* by J.L. Menezes,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and
a href="http://www.thbookservice.com/
"\>The Sword of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Prophet by Serge Trifkovic. These books, I am told,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#talk about the dark underside of Islam and Mohammed, including his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#taking a **very** young girl as one of his multiple\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wives, and other war time activities. It really says something\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when a faith has to use legal action and the threat thereof to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#suppress criticism of it. It says even more of our culture, and of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Australia's culture, that it worked.
