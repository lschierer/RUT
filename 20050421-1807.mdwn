A (relatively) long time ago, I [wrote](view.php?date=20050125-1135) [about](view.php?date=20050127-1430) the no smoking policy of Weyco, a Michigan based\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#health care company. For those that do not remember, or have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not read that far back in time, Weyco prohibits employees from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#smoking **at all**. Not just on company time or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#company property, but even at home. They have instituted the sort\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of random drug testing more common with illegal drugs to enforce\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the ban also. At first I was somewhat in favor of this, certainly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ambivalent. In my second glance, I am mostly against it, though\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#still somewhat unsure. This long introduction comes because of [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GuestColumns/Stossel20050420.shtml). Apparently some of the smokers are quite upset over\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this policy. And some of them are pushing law makers in Michigan\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to prevent it. With at least some success. In my views of it so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#far, I have focused on its potential impact on the employee, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(via the premiums we pay) on the person's co-workers and society\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as a whole. John Stossel takes a different approach. He looks\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at it from the point of view of the employer, who, in this case,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is Mr. Weyers, owner of the company. Where does his freedom to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#employ who he wants, to pay who he wants, start? Where does it stop?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#While this is a company doing this, and *not* a government,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the freedom to work elsewhere exists. So since it is his company\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and his money, why should not he have the freedom to enact and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#enforce his own standards? If he thinks it is morally wrong to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#smoke, a tenable position (see my second post on this subject),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#naturally he should enforce such a policy. On the other hand,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#given the impact on premiums, its easy to see smoking leading to a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sort of blacklisting effect. At first, this would tend me towards\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"but people have a right to work, the right to earn a living to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#raise their family." Which is true, they do. But this is not a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#life-time ban; they simply have to quit smoking, something that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would be good for them anyway. So in that sense, it is much like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#saying the alcoholic needs to get help and get in control of his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#addiction before he will be able to hold a job, something that is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#eminently reasonable, and eminently common sensical. So I guess my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#overall conclusion is that since this **is** a company,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and not a government, and in light of the premium impact on others,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and in light of the need to respect the employer's freedom and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#responsibilities as well as the employee's, it appears that this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sort of policy is justifiable. I do am not so sure the same thing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would hold true of a government policy implementing the same sort\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of thing. And I am less sure of this with regards to weight than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am smoking, as I still believe our idea of "overweight" is off\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#kilter (note I also still admit I need to loose *some* weight.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Just not as much as the federal definitions would require.).
