Interesting that the military understands the implications of our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#push for gender equality.[1] I am not saying that women should not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have a choice of careers beyond the home, nor that they should be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#denied access to medical school or law school the way they once\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where when the feminists were truly feminists. I *am*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#saying that some jobs are not appropriate for a woman to have,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that other jobs are only truly appropriate to those few women\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who have the ability to do the same physical work as a guy holding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that job would be expected to do.

The military's combat roles, both as a soldier in combat, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#also as a support/supply person exposed to combat, is one place\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women simply do not belong. Once we knew that. For centuries men\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#understood their call to be gentlemen, and to protect the women\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#around them. Because women and men *are* different.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Now however, we have lost that. We have women, in Iraq and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Afghanistan, ending up *in* combat even though they are still,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for now, banned from combat units. The Pentagon looks at this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and looks at the recruitment figures, and looks at the deployment\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#needs, and is responding with a push to put women in combat roles,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to further blur the distinction between the sexes. *Congress*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is thus left as the break, attempting to preserve the ban as it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was intended, to keep women out of harms way while allowing them\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to serve in areas not so utterly incompatible with a proper view\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of their place in a civilized society. I am sure that no mention\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is needed of the irony here, and thus the potential for further\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#societal decay.
