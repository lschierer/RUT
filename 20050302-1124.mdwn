Michelle Malkin is incredibly critical of Newt Gingrich's "[Transform\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It, Don't Reform It](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64393-2005Mar1.html?sub=AR)" in her post, "[Gingrich's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Bold Medicaid Reform Proposal](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001632.htm)." However, I cannot entirely\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#agree. Gingrich's proposal would substantially increase the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bureaucracy involved in Medicaid, tripling it. But I think that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*if* we are to have a Medicaid, that the goals he outlines\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are worthwhile. I have faced some of the problems he outlines in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Medicaid's treatment of the elderly, he's right, it is anti-family.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And that isn't just. He is also correct in pointing out that a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one sized fits all approach does not best serve the needs of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#elderly, the poor, and the disabled. I'd still argue that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Federal Government has no place in this sort of charitable work,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but, as I said, *if* we are stuck with having a Medicaid,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#then his sounds at worst more humane than the present.
