This is scary and exciting beyond belief. "[Altered\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#HIV Attacks Mice Tumors](http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,66579,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1)" talks about a research project in which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#HIV was altered to attack cancer cells instead of immune cells.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It was apparently rather successful in mice. They claim it isn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#really much of a risk because they "have completely removed 80\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#percent of the virus. So really it's just a carrier." Obviously a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#potential cure for cancer needs nothing else to be exciting really,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but this is especially so because they are building a cure from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a plague. What a mind-boggling example of bringing good from evil!\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is scary though. The claim is they can target "any protein on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the surface of a cell" and have "seen success with about a dozen\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#different molecules, including brain and other blood cells."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#On one hand, this will make it particularly effective, it can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be customized for the various cancers, making it potentially\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#particularly effective, assuming there is a way to tell the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#difference between the cancer cell and the normal cell from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cell surface for any given type of cell. On the other hand though,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the potential for biological weaponry of particular nastiness,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#especially for those with a genocidal bent (Saddam Hussein, your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#average PLA suicide bomber wishing to kill Jews, several instances\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of this in Africa currently, the whole Bosnia/Serbia thing not long\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ago..) is not particularly far under the surface here, now is it?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Just goes to show, technology is never in and of itself good or evil,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it all comes down to the use to which man puts it.
