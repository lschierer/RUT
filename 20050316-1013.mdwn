Charles Krauthammer is a hypocrite.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Fairly blatantly so. At the top of "[Thou\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Shalt Not Create](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/charleskrauthammer/ck20050311.shtml)," after quoting President Bush's commitment\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to end research on human embryos, he says\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> That declaration drew more than applause. It received a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#standing ovation from both sides of the aisle -- demonstrating that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even amid the confusion and dishonesty in this country's bioethics\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#debates, some truths remain self-evident. And one of those truths is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that human embryos are to be created for the purpose of producing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#human babies, not for commerce and not to be dismembered for study\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or spare parts.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but further down in his article, he's not opposed to, is in fact\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in favor of using the discarded embryos from IVF for research.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Apparently, in his eyes, it is okay to destroy a human embryo if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you create it for some other purpose, but not if you create it to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#destroy it. The hypocrisy here is nearly self evident, but I suppose\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I must acknowledge that there is one loophole. I would argue that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#IVF is equally immoral, and equally deserves to be banned. It is,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just as cloning would, creating human life with the intent to end\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it: to discard most of the created embryos. It is possible that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this logic, self-evident to me, has not occurred to him. If so,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he is not a hypocrite, but an fool. Were he ever to read these\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#words, he might not like that appellation any better. ;-)
