#+TITLE: Heather had two moms

The [National Catholic Register](http://www.ncregister.com) takes a look at an odd case in California as a homosexual couple splits up as an opportunity to look at how the Church's teaching on marriage would save us heartache and grief.^[[1]](http://www.ncregister.com/articulo.php?artkod=ODI=)^ It is worth reading and considering as so many jurisdictions face the question of whether to allow homosexual "marriages" or not.
