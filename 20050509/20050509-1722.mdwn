<p>Apparently Weyco is not alone in banning employees from smoking,
not just at work, but at all.[1] Larry Elder also moves towards the
humorous in comparing some of the statistics about smokers to some
of those about democrats.  The one example that struck me was the
banning of smokers, not because of the health risks and related
expenses to the employer, but because of the <em>image</em> that
smokers have.  Wow!, and here I thought that Weyco was extreme!</p>
