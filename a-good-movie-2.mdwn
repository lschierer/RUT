#+TITLE: A Good movie

I just watch "National Treasure" for the first time tonight. While admittedly there were parts I more listened to than watched, that was more because I am addicted to Civilization style games than because the movie wasn't good. Still, I am very confident in saying there was no sex scene in the movie, not all that much gratuitous language, and no gore. Pretty cool.
