#+TITLE: Protecting the Pledge

The Knights, instrumental in causing Congress to add the words "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance back in 1954, are now defending their/our achievement according to [CNA](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/).^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4899)^ This is good to see, as I cannot imagine the school districts fighting this decision as committedly as the Knights will.

On a side note, I did not know that you *could* ask to become a defendant in a case like this.
