"[Scientists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#create animals that are part-human](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7681252/)" is a sort of crossover\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#science/pro-life article. Transplants from animals have saved lives,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no question about it. But something disturbs me in the thought of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#using animals to grow actual human organs. I do not know, where\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does the line lay? Where does this cross the bounds of moral means?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#These are questions that the scientists will never adequately ask,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and our government cannot be trusted to answer. We must think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about this. I thank God once again for giving us a scholar Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to lead us through these times.
