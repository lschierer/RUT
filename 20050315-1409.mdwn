"[Sunlight\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in a tube](http://www.world-science.net/othernews/050310_suntubefrm.htm)" reports on the sort of environmentalism that we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can and should all support. Replacing some of our florescent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lighting with transported sunlight would I think be beneficial\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to more than just our pocket books. While it will, doubtlessly,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be expensive to install such systems for the near future, over\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time the cost should pay itself off in decreased electrical usage.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Additionally, everyone (except those who are allergic to sunlight\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I suppose (yes, such people do exist)) must prefer natural light\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the horrid florescent lighting. Many people even prefer the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"warmer" lighting from incandescent bulbs over florescent, even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#though florescent provide brighter light longer and cheaper than the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incandescent bulbs do. How much better to have real sunlight.
