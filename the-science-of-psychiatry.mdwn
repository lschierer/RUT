#+TITLE: the "science" of psychiatry

The question of whether psychiatry is a science or not seems to have been settled as far as the Spanish Senate is concerned.[[1]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4118374.stm) When a political party has to apologize for the professional statements a professor makes *inside his field*, then clearly we are *not* dealing with science.

That being said, I think this demonstrates something about the homosexual lobby and movement. Clearly they think that science is only infallible and must only be bowed down to when it serves their purpose. Thus if they think they can prove homosexuality is genetically based, we must give in to science and accept it. However, if we can prove that it is a disease, the science must be apologized for, and is not to be used to stand in the way of "progress" and "tolerance."
