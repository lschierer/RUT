In "[For\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#boys and girls, go single sex](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/richlowry/rl20050317.shtml)," Rich Lowry looks at some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#differences in the way boys and girls learn, and from that,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#extrapolates some of the flaws in our current education system.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In doing so, he highlights the reasoning that led to the popularity\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of single sex high schools a generation ago. This conforms to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#common sense test. William and Michael, coming through high school,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had trouble reading a book if it did not include action or sports\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the first few pages. The more restrained classical literature,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or, even more, the books assigned in class, had little interest.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Why do we read *Romeo and Juliet* but not *Henry V*?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If you wanted to pick a Shakespeare play likely to encourage guys\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to get past the unfamiliar verbiage, you would have trouble picking\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one more likely to appeal to guys than *Henry V*. Which is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not to say that I am not in favor of assigning classical literature.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is something that high school students should be presented with.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I just do not remember the grade school texts well enough to use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them as an example.
