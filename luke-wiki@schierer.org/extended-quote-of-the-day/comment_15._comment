<p>The misuse of the probability arises when the conditions applied to calculate it are not related as they seem or other conditions are missing. For example, if you come up with a precise, calculated probability for evolution and you multiply it by the number of stars believed to exist in the Universe (280 billion square 2), you could easily top close, or even over 1/1, which would not be a valid number. I could easily accept that this example is a misuse of probability and the reason is clear. Your number would not have specified "number of stars" being equal to 1 as a prerequisite to its calculation. This is just an example. "Now how does this affect my nice, astonishing probability number", you may ask. Simple... the calculation of the probability only has to take in consideration <em>one</em> factor that is completely unrelated to the evolution theory to be flawed. In the links I mentioned before, you'll find many indications of such factors, and actually it's easy to imagine how such factors would be present. Life still so complex to us that it's unlikely that anyone would be able to come up with a nice and polished probability number regarding its evolution.
I don't know for a fact that the evolution theory is absolutely true, but I find that there are enough indications that it's closer to the truth than what ID tries to argue.
The magic about any "creator" theory is that it can easily explain everything. Even if in the next minute you change your mind and accept evolution as the most probable explanation for our current existence, you can still say that the Creator made things as they are so that evolution would hold like it does. For me, that's just the easy way out, just like our ancestors liked to believe that a lightning would have stricken their apple tree because the Creator wasn't happy with them instead of understanding that it was only a matter of static electricity.</p>
