<p>The testing has been going on for over 100 years now on evolution.  Things that once appeared to favor it have now been disproven.  Worse, new evidence has come to light that is entirely and radically incompatible with it. When does it stop being a scientific theory, and start being the sort of blind faith you describe?  I assert that anyone who thinks evolution is true is operating <em>far more</em> on blind faith than I am.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the the concept of a Creator.  I <em>do</em> believe in a creator, but that is not at issue here.  The fact of the matter is that the experimental evidence, as discussed in both the work I quote here and in other works, points to a Creator.  The evidence speaks nothing as to the nature of that Creator.</p>

<p>As far as science goes, the Creator could be one in a long line of creators, or it could be the sort of eternal timeless Being proposed by the Christian faith (among others).  Science does not say, and so I do not address it here.</p>

<p>You may not be able to understand why the Creator created.  But that does not disprove the evidence pointing to the Creator's existence.</p>

<p>By the way, I do not propose that the Creator did so out of boredom or amusement.  But at this point in our ability to research, such arguments are for philosophy, including but not limited to logical analysis, and not for science.  I would like to limit this thread to scientific concerns.</p>
