<p>To summarize again, there is no proof for evolution.  There is disproof of it.</p>

<p>The existing evidence supports the idea of a Creator.  There is no evidence that does not match this hypothesis.</p>

<p>As a scientist, you are going to tell me that you chose to believe in evolution, despite the evidence against it, just because you cannot understand the Creator?  Where does "I do not understand" or "I do not like this idea" fit into the principles of science?</p>
