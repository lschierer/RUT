<p>That does not explain the nearly infinite odds against the universe having laws that allow for life.  Nor has it really been proven that the universe "tends to[wards being] infinite."</p>

<p>Infinity is a troubling concept in and of itself though.  For if you advocate that we can treat the universe as being infinite, you are advancing the notion that not only <em>can</em> anything happen, but that it <em>must.</em>  Not just can intelligent life exist here on Earth, but there <em>must</em> be someone somewhere out there with your exact memories, holding this conversation with someone else who has my exact memories.  The odds of that, assuming we are in fact the result of a random undirected process, and that all we do and think can be explained in such terms, are incredibly low.  But in an infinite universe, everything must happen.</p>

<p>In short, believing in a truly infinite universe is a much bigger proposition to ask someone to accept than a Creator.</p>

<p>Any of those being granted though, evolution would still not be proven.  There <em>are</em> <strong>no</strong> samples for your belief to be based on.</p>
