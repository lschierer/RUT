<p>Well, the good thing about science is that the samples come as experimentation goes, while pure faith doesn't even care about sampling, since believing is an end in itself with no need for proof.
In the other hand, the concept of a Creator as an entity with a conscience seems to be a bit unexplainable to me. For someone that considers that as true, I see only two options. Either the Creator always existed as in a timeless thing, or it was itself created by an even "higher" Creator. 
In the first case, I fail to understand why a timeless entity would care to give a kick-start to our Universe, then sit down and watch what would happen other than for its own amusement. Amusement, by the way, seems to be a human concept that shouldn't be applicable to an omniscient and omnipresent entity. I find that less credible than the relationship between a very big space plus a very long time and the odds you raised. 
The second case, which sounds more likely to me, tends to an infinite number of "Creator layers". In that case, believing in and worshiping our Creator would be to deal with a middle man. Someone that is actually quite sloppy when it deals to communicating its intentions. Even quite sadistic for putting all life under such a range of stressful tests. 
Worse, the concept of "love" defined by most religions doesn't fit in the blackmailing preached by the same religions: "I love you, no matter what you do or what you are" versus "worship me and you'll sit by my side for all eternity, negate me and you'll burn instead".</p>
