<p>One thing is certain -- legislating morality is wrong because it's both impractical and hypocritical. If all have sinned, how could we punish sin? We'd have to punish everyone.</p>

<p>And you are completely backwards -- you don't reform society to reform the church, you reform the church to reform society. Or so Jesus thought. But what'd he know? ;-p</p>
