<p>The patch versions I see are standard patch files, addressing the kernel source for those building a new kernel.  I could use that in place of steps 2-5 above, and would go that route on any machine I needed a custom kernel for anyway.</p>

<p>Building a kernel with an additional driver is not hard, once the system is installed, and assuming that I am handing this off to a customer with a clueful administrator.  Some of our customers are more clueful than others though.</p>

<p>Most people using these cards avoid this whole issue by having an IDE or separate SATA drive for /boot (or / if /boot is not separate). If I could get away with doing that, I would not have complained about it. Though I have not seen your script, I can pretty much infer that it assumes you have taken this route.  Afterall, to run a script, you have to have a running system.</p>
