Some things to keep in mind.  Under French law, arson is a misdemeanor, at least for minors.  You cannot be held for misdemeanor charges for longer than two hours.  So you'd have young people set fire to things, get arrested, get released and set fire to things again.  Also, they could legally not enforce any sort of curfew until they found an old Frech Colonial law that was written for Algeria that happened to have a loophole that allowed it to be enforced in france.  Thought these things were noteworthy.
