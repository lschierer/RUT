<p>The priest is not saying "The Lord be with you" in the modern english sense.  He is saying it in the old english sense.  It is not a greeting.  It is a statement.  "The Lord is with you".  The response indicates an understanding of something greater.  The logical response is "The Lord is with you" as in "The Lord is with you too".  But the response in the liturgy implies something greater .  "And with your spirit".  The spirit that surrounds you by virtue of your ordination, the aura, the air, as Christ makes his work manifest through you.  The only ones permitted to say "Dominus Vobiscum"  "The Lord be with thee" is a priest or a deacon.  Anyone else who says it is violating canon.   I know this may not still make you happy, but perhaps we can run this off of blogging and into the realm of lunch or IM?</p>
