[...] Still, as &#8220;nation&#8221; so defined need not be codified into a &#8220;state,&#8221; as, for example (an example particularly close to Mr. Ciziunas&#8217; heart), Lithuania was not under Communist occupation, this train of thought is rather tangential and hypothetical. This form of extreme patriotism, statism, is problematic whether or not one drags in a concept of nation into it; we need not needlessly inflate the importance of something of such inherently great import.
