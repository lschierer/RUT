<p>Wow that article is nearly unreadable on firefox...</p>

<p>As someone who's been using Pidgin (GAIM before Pidgin) since around 2001, I think your project is better than ever... People that complain about it must have nothing better to do...</p>

<p>It's so ubiquitous to me (and the 4 <em>different</em> chat networks I'm connected to) that it actually surprised me when I got a new windows laptop for work and it wasn't installed yet LOL... I sometimes forget that there are some operating systems that don't have it in their package set.</p>

<p>Thank you and your friends for your contributions, some of us appreciate them. You and your peeps are doing a hella great job!</p>
