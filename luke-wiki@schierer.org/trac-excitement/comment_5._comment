Well, The new Pidgin is AWESOME.  But every time I get in #pidgin, somebody is a jerk.  It's usually somebody with op powers that then kicks random people for no good reason.  I mean, if you really want to dominate the IM world (which you are clearly in a position to do, as Pidgin is the best IM out right now, and lots of neophytes agree on that, by the way), you should try to build more good will by not being total dicks in the irc chan, or giving total assholes op powers.  <em>I</em> have not been kicked, btw, so I'm not crying sour grapes, but I see it all the time, and I've been called stupid, seen other people similarly abused who genuinely did not deserve it.  I think you need to totally re-orchestrate who has op powers in the chan, and encourage the devs or whoever it is in there being a dick to grow up and knock it off.

Then implement a good speex chat plugin and dominate the world.  That is my most earnest hope!

Thanks again for such a great IM client!!
