In Germany prostitution is legal. Not only legal, it is a "normal,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tax paying industry which has access to official databases of job\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seekers. Yes, the scum who run such things can call you up if they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like the sound of your resume and try to get you to work for them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Now Germany is also in quite a fix because it is a welfare state.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And in trying to get a handle on that, it has decided that if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you are out of work for more than a year, and you turn down a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#job offer, you can have your welfare benefits cut. How does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this relate? Some scumbag offers you a job as a prostitute,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you turn him down, now all of a sudden you don't get welfare.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Now, I'm against welfare in general and in principle, but in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#presence of a welfare state, with its high taxes, people are hard\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pressed to fund private/religious social services. Add into the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mix Germany's ever increasing atheist populations (well, its Muslim\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#population is probably increasing faster, but outside of that),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and you have a situation that is worse than welfare: you have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women being forced into prostitution by the state. Lovely. See [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#telegraph.co.uk article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/01/30/wgerm30.xml) for documentation of this outrage.
