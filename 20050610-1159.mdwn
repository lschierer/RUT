Taking morphine is addictive, but we proscribe it for the dieing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to ease their pain. This is good. Chemotherapy and radiation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#therapy are both practices in which we do things that kill all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cells because they happen to kill cancer cells faster. We use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these treatments on patients every day, we have nothing better, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sometimes they work. So I am very sympathetic with those who have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been prescribed marijuana as a pain killer by a competent doctor.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The doctor may be right, the cost of not taking it may be higher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than the cost of the addictiveness and side effects.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But it is illegal. And everyone knows it is illegal, and so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is highly irresponsible for these doctors to be prescribing it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anyway. And Mr. William F. Buckley is correct, it is laudable for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Supreme Court to refuse to legislate from the bench.[1] While\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I might question the constitutionality of the illegal drug laws\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#themselves, I do not think I would win even with courts benched by\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#constitutionalists. And given that, it was the right decision, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seems to me that a strong case can be made that this is interstate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#trade. Of course, if it were not universally illegal, perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it could be grown in California for use in California pharmacies,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but that argument was not made here, or at least in the report of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it I see.[1]

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
But Mr. Buckley does make one rhetorical error. He criticizes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. John P. Walters, President Bush's drug czar, for "dogmatic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#positions." I infer from this wording that Mr. Buckley thinks the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#positions are not backed by fact. That dogma is necessarily somehow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less than science. An utterly bogus line of reasoning. Perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Walters' statements are dogmatic. Perhaps he *is* wrong,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but he is not wrong *because* his statements are dogmatic.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Mr. Buckley then goes on to state that because you can find\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some people helped by marijuana, statements that it has not been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"medically established that marijuana uniquely grants such relief\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as is being touted" must be inaccurate. I wonder if Mr. Buckley is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#familiar with the use of placebos in medical research. I wonder\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#if he is aware that we do so because some people will experience\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#relief simply because they think they should. The relief is no less\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#real, it is not hallucination. It is simply evidence that the mind,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the will, can act in ways science cannot explain. Mr. Buckley\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#should also take a look at the current FDA rules and regulations,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and how hard it is to get a new drug approved, before he criticizes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the drug czar's statements in this manner. He should perhaps be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#talking about reforming FDA instead.
