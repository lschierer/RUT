#+TITLE: Harddrive encryption

[Ars](http://arstechnica.com "ars technica home page") takes a look at the hard drive encryption option slated to be in Microsoft Vista in light of the fact that talks between the United Kingdom and Microsoft have occurred on the subject of backdoor access.^[[1]](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060215-6185.html\ "Britain\ wants\ access\ to\ encrypted\ Vista\ hard\ drives")^ In short, the UK is concerned that its police forces might not have access to hard drives when they seize computers as part of an investigation. As Ars notes, this is a concern that other governments are going to have similar concerns, if they have not initiated talks with Microsoft on their own already. It should be noted, however, that it is quite likely that any back door installed for a government will be discovered by someone else, and used against consumers, as well as by one government against others. Such a backdoor would render the hard drive encryption idea worse than useless, it would become a false sense of security.
