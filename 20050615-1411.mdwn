Ms. Phyllis Schlafly has some interesting facts on the way the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#courts have furthered the destruction of the concept of fatherhood\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in our society.[1] You see a similar dynamic in the areas of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sexual assault and domestic violence: you are considered guilty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from the moment the charge comes out. You are considered guilty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even if found innocent. Your attempts to defend yourself will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#just earn you greater enmity from society, from your persecutors,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and from the legal system. Both crimes are real. Both deserve\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*severe* punishment. But we have forgotten that not all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#men accused are guilty. We have even forgotten that not all men\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are even accused of them.
