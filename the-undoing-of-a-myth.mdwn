> Abortion proponents have long argued that a right to abortion should be guaranteed by international law because restricting abortion leads to high maternal mortality. However, UN reports such as the 1991 World Health Organization (WHO) report "Maternal Mortality, A Global Factbook," conclude that decreased maternal mortality rates in the developed world, "coincided with the development of obstetric techniques and improvements in the general health status of women." Subsequent WHO reports have identified low social and economic status, unskilled birthing attendants, and poor nutrition as underlying causes of maternal mortality. They also identify anemia and malaria as primary indirect causes of maternal deaths in Africa.^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^
