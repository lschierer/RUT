YMCA itself has nothing to do with homosexuality.  The thing that might is the assumed orientation of "The Village People" (and the popularity of dressing up as them by stereotypically gay men).  Search images.google for "The Village People" if you don't know quite what I'm talking about.  It's nothing vile.
