Along the same lines as [my previous post^[1]^](https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20051228-0959/the-health-benefits-of-the-sun "The Health Benefits of the Sun"), all sorts of people bemoan deforestation as a prime cause of global warming. They do this despite the fact that I have heard some studies suggest that there are actually *more* trees now than there were in the days of unchecked wildfires before the colonial period. Be that as it may, it turns out to still be too simplistic a view.^[[2]](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,69914-0.html\ "Careful\ Where\ You\ Put\ That\ Tree")^ It appears that northern forests have a higher cost in albedo change than they provide benefit in carbon absorption. This result reminds me of some of the other speculations I have made regarding albedo, I wonder anew what else they have failed to consider.
