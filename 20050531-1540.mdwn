Not every family is in the financial or physical situation to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#able to provide the care that an elderly relative can often come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to need. Ideally of course, you would take care of your family\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yourself, live in close proximity, or as health deteriorates,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have a parent or grandparent move in. Still, I recognize, have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seen in my own family, that sometimes the assistance of assisted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#living or a nursing facility becomes necessary. If you are not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#able to lift them for exampleâ€¦. Still, the nursing home\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is in and of itself less than ideal. Further, it is not used as a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#last resort by far too big a percentage of the family. Even worse,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many elderly people are more or less abandoned in such facilities,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#visited rarely if at all, nearly forgotten except the occasional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#phone call, sometimes even living far from any family. To make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#matters worse, Toyota seems to think it would be a good idea to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#delegate the care of these people to a robotic staff.[1] Now they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are to be denied even the minimal comfort of contact with unknown,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#harried, and busy staff. Perhaps worse, they want to delegate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the raising of children to robots, when intuition, common sense,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#instinct, *and* research all highlight the absolute critical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nature of human interaction in a child's development. This is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tragic development.
