The Catholic News Agency is reporting that one of the Bishops in China loyal to the Pope has been arrested *again*.[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4301) Apparently this is the sixth time in eighteen months.

In better news, they claim there are *twelve million* Catholics (not fake "Patriotic Catholics") in China!!
