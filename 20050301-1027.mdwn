Has it really been 3 days since my last post? I guess it has,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a weekend and then a snowy trip to the FDA's Twinbrook MD facility\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will do that I guess. I did spend some time over the weekend on a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#semi-blog related topic, I set up [a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#page on privacy related laws and regulations](./privacyupdate.php) which may or may\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not stay right where it is now, but will be updated as I remember to.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#

I am very glad the snow did not significantly stick to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#roads yesterday. As stated above, I found myself headed out to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#visit the FDA to update their cluster. When I left the office,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it was just starting to snow significantly, and was not sticking.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I was expecting to go out there, update a single box, and head home.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Two, maybe 3 hours tops. I was wrong. They hadn't finished backups\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#when I arrived, and they wanted me to go go ahead and reconfigure the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cluster from the three cluster testing setup (One scyld which I was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#making a clustermatic, One oscar, One clustermatic) into one large\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cluster, all clustermatic. Problem: they have 65 nodes, half-rack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#units, with units mounted on each side of the rack. And oscar\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nodes boot from the hard disk while clustermatic nodes boot from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the network. So I had to reach *between* the nodes to plug\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in a monitor and keyboard to change the boot order in the bios.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Oh and these are labeled *on the front but not on the side*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And did I mention that they are not fully sequential and that order\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does matter? You begin to see why I was there till somewhat after\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#5pm now. By which point significant snow *had* accumulated,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but fortunately not much on the roads, so I was able to get home\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without too much trouble. Quite an adventure.
