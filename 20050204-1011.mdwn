How much control over your property\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#should the federal government have? In "[High\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Court Review of Wetland Case Sought](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-4-2005/20050204021502_8.html)," the Supreme Court is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being asked to look at a case in which a man as been sentenced to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time in prison for filling in some wetlands he owns. Two concerns\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here, 1)does the 1972 Clean Water Act protect wet lands that are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unconnected to navigable water, and 2)should the federal government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be involved in this at all? Conservation is all well and good,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we are called to exercise responsibility in our use of the world\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and its resources, not to wantonly destroy it. Thus many times,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conservationists are raising legitimate points along with utter\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nonsense. The trick is to figure out where the nonsense starts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(and ends), and what role the federal government can and should have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in preventing extremes on both ends from happening. I'm tempted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to say that the federal government does have *some* say in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this, as watershed areas, rivers, and such often extend beyond\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the bounds of a state, much less a local government. Still, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do not like to see the federal government deciding that you can't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#use land you own. If they are going to declare it unusable land,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#there should be some offer to make it a park or preserve involved.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#On the other hand, part of me thinks that we'll end up where the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only parks will be the unusable lands, as larger and larger areas\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are pushing for development.

 "[The mud puddle preservation plan](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/terencejeffrey/tj20050202.shtml), by Terence Jeffrey, gives another view of this same issue, that exposes just how far this can go, and how rediculous it can get.
