Mr. Burt Prelutsky is incredibly harsh on the ladies.^[[1]](http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/BurtPrelutsky/2006/03/07/188868.html\ "Moms\ make\ lousy\ dads")^ His point, however poorly worded, is important, and his example (elephants) even more so. Simply put, men and women are equal in some respects (their inherent human dignity for example) but not in others. Rather, they are complementary. Thus the ideal family includes both a father and a mother, both being necessary to provide the most ideal environment for the raising of both male and female children. Sure, single dads can do well, and single moms can do well. And yes, some couples will fail to raise their children properly. It is not, however, *ideal* for a woman to be a single mom, or a man to be a single father. For this reason, widows and widowers would remarry, often thinking more of their children's needs than their own.
