\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# We now know that our Pope will likely die\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# in the next few days, baring a miracle. "[Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Said Conscious, in Grave Condition](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050401/D896N6880.html) states that the chances\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# of him surviving the "septic shock" that he is said to have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# and be experiencing, is very very low. The other day I found "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Blessed Sounds of Silence](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/thiessen200503311119.asp)" from some blog, most likely\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Michelle Malkin's. It is a very lucid, very moving reflection.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# Pray for our Pope, as he finishes his life, but more, pray for us\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# who he leaves behind, we are all loosing a great Pope, a great man.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# We are all, in a very real sense, loosing our father. At least,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# that is how it feels to me, the Church is my home, and the Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# is the head of that family, just as my father was unquestionably\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# the head of ours. An self-proclaimed atheist in \#gaim said to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# me yesterday "either way, I hope the Church has half the wisdom\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# of appointing a suitable replacement. He is a much beloved man,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# even by many of us non-Catholics." He is a man who has touched\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# the whole world, truly lived as "pope," which I understand is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\# derivative of "papa."

Yesterday my mom and brothers went to the Gift of Peace house\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in D.C. The Sisters expect that we will see an increase in evil as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a result of this ending mess surrounding the life, and now death,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Mrs. Schiavo. Pray for us, Holy Father, before God, we are in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#need of your intercession, for us, before Him, more than ever.
