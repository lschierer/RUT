I went to the one man play on the ideas of G.K. Chesterton that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholic Campus Ministry sponsored at the Johnson Center Cinema.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It was a lot of fun. It reminded me of many good points, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[re]introduced me to a few that I had either forgotten or have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not read as yet. He wrote long ago, it seems to me, though not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so long in terms of the long sweep of human history, and yet his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#points are as pertinent today as they were then. I did not stay\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to try to pick the brains of the students, few of which I know\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even by face or name any more, and none of whom would know how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to respond to me. I do however wonder what they made of it, they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were presented with a view far from the common one you see today.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He did not at all try to soften the views of Mr. Chesterton, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#presented a wide range of Mr. Chesterton's most controversial views.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He looked at politics where Mr. Chesterton comes down hard against\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#humanists, universalists, socialists and communists. He looked at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the differences between the sexes, men and women are intrinsically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#different. Mr. Chesterton went somewhat farther than I would dare\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to do today. He came down against having given women the vote.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#His logic is that in doing so, we have removed one unintended check\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on government, it is now taken seriously by all, whereas before,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our wives and sisters might well have scoffed at us men for taking it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so seriously. I do not know, I think that at this point we could not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#justly go back, even *if* he is right that we would be better\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#off had women not been given the vote. He takes on contraception,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tolerance, and evolution. Always with common sense arguments that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I fear people would be far too quick to dismiss today, for all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no one has refuted them. He takes on women working. He clearly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#points out much of the illogic of the early feminist arguments.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That it is utterly ironic and illogical to say that motherhood is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a small job, or a meaningless one, but that teaching is a larger.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That it is ironic that one would refuse to be dictated to, yet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#take a job as a secretary or stenographer, or in a typing pool.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Some of his arguments here have lost their weight: typing pools\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are largely if not entirely a thing of the past, and women are in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#far more fields and career paths than they were in his day. Still,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as I look around me at this world, I cannot help but wonder, what\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has been the cost of the working mom? Greater than those who go to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#work would ever dare admit. It is a question that has no answer,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because for a guy like me to ask it is to be accused of being sexist\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and dismissed, and no working woman would, for she would have to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#question her own motives. Does she go to work because its best for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#family and society, or because she wants to? And he points out the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#freedom and joy that come from following the Catholic precepts.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Surprising joy, paradoxical joy, but more real than any other.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Joy that he is not alone in finding, Scott Hahn and other protestant\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#converts find the same. Joy that takes the previous controversies\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and stands them on their heads, for the argument is that we should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all do what makes us happy, but this shows that we do not always\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#know what will best achieve that end.
