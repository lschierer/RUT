#+TITLE: Polygyny coming to Canada?

More accurately, polygyny is already there, the question is whether or not it will become officially legal.[\^200708301] I am disgusted almost beyond words. The one comment worthy aspect of the article is the trenchant observation that freedom of religion would have to give way if this were a question of homosexual rights or marriage, but is held up as absolute when it comes to polygynous marriage. It is almost beyond belief. How can a people that celebrates the value of women allow thisâ€½ \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200708301]: Mr. Steve Weatherbe.
