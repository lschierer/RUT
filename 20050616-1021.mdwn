USA Today has a story about a Virginia family that needs\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#prayers.[1] The Torres family is faced with incredible suffering,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as Mrs. Susan Torres is brain dead, kept alive by a respirator,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#while her body fights cancer and other illnesses so that her unborn\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#baby has a chance at life. If they can reach mid-July without the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cancer reaching her uterus, the baby will have reached 25 weeks,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and will have a chance of life if delivered then. If they can reach\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#30 weeks, the risks of brain, vision, and developmental damage will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be significantly less. Pray for Mr. Jason Torres, her husband,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and their 2 year old son Peter, and for the unborn baby.
