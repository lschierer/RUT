I totally forgot when I wrote my mom's poem viewer that the php "include" command would include remote files. Someone from Argentina took advantage of this fact to hack my server yesterday night, a fact I learned yesterday morning.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Unfortunately my work backing up the data I wanted to preserve was far from complete. Most notably, I lost my cron jobs, my iptables script, and all but the photos from my gallery2 install, as the mysql dump alone appears to be next to useless.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Further, in bringing the mail server back up, I neglected to ensure my .qmail files were in place \_before\_ starting the mail server, so I'm pretty sure I lost mail. Lovely.
