There is just one thing about "[Defense:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#England Oxygen-Deprived at Birth](http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/6003001da897b509.html)" that I want to comment on.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It mentions "a psychologist testifying that the reservist was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#oxygen-deprived at birth, speech impaired and had trouble learning\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to read." A ***psychologist*** is testifying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on this‽ His area of expertise is *what* now‽\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Reading further, perhaps he is simply testifying to the fact that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#he has been aware of this diagnosis for years. Either way, it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#evidence of the disturbing trend to question the priest but trust\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the psychologist. I fail to grasp what the material difference is,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#except, of course, that you have had a chance to know what sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#person the priest is from his homilies, but you know nothing about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the psychologist except possibly a recommendation.
