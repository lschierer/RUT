Brian McNicoll holds an odd, but all too common, set of ideas.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He thinks that the problems with Darwinism stop at the explanation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of intelligence. He thinks Galileo was arrested for believing the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Earth orbits the sun. He thinks that the proof of the age of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Earth is fairly solid. Of these, one is false, one is blatantly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#false, and the other is debatable but believable.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Intelligent Design has poked far more holes in Darwinism than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the age-old question of how did intelligence develop. As far\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as that goes, evolution is more or less right, it is not that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simple. It likely did not produce exactly 2 thinking beings,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but a population. It likely did not produce what we now know as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#intelligence or morality over night. If it happened evolutionarily\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at all, it happened gradually and over time. However, it is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unlikely that it did happen via evolution. Far from being a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#good guess, a near guess, evolution is simply wrong. And here,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. McNicoll makes a surprising statement, he recognizes that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Galileo was wrong. Galileo was bad science, and his theory had\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all of the same complexity, epicycles, fudging the "center" of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#solar system, so on, that geocentrism did. It was Kepler who came\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up with ellipses (at the same time Galileo was pushing circles,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Kepler was asking him for support), and did so from is own, odd\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but real, religious beliefs. Science is known for its mistakes.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It thought light needed a media (ether). Turns out that it does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not seem to. It thought Newton's three laws described reality.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They do not. They provide useful results on a human scale, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fail, utterly and completely, on a solar scale or on a atomic scale.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They thought that men and women breathed differently, they do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(in any meaningful sense), the difference was a difference in garments.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They thought leaches and bleeding were a kind of cure-all, that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the body was made of humors. They studied alchemy (Newton is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#well known for it). They have advocated all sorts of silly (in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#retrospect) things. Yet they still insist that their theories\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can and should be trusted, blindly, to describe reality, instead\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of merely "saving the facts" more or less well. They persist in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#making Galileo's *real* mistake: asserting that their math\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#must be true in an absolute sense, must be a true, in an absolute\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sense, explanation, not merely a description.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The flaw here is subtle. It will escape many readers (if I had\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#many readers). Granted God truly is omniscient and omnipotent, is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it possible for Him to have created a world that *appears*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be thousands of years old, but is not? Obviously yes. I do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not believe He would intentionally deceive us, but the overall\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#point remains. We *cannot* know that our understanding\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the world is complete or correct. The world could be far\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more complex than we are yet aware, and it is shear presumption\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to assume that because we know of no more, that we must be right,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that revealed Truth must give way before our guesses, guesses\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that time and time again we have rejected in favor of more complex\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(relativity is certainly more complex than Newton's 3 laws, otherwise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you would not use Newton as an approximation any more, you would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#simply use the more simple theory directly), but more accurate.
