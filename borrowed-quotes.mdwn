yay for a recent meme in the community that generates a plethora of quotable quotes. ☺ Two more for the collection:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them." —George Orwell\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value." —Carl Sagan\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Proof, if any were needed (I have a quote from Freud in my collection after all), that even those I tend to disagree with can produce a pearl of wisdom now and then.
