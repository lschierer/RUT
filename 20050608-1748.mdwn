The recent "protest" involving a mock marriage in Notre Dame in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which one person pretended to be a priest[1] seems rather revealing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to me. It seems clear from this that they are in fact not simply\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pushing for the civil benefits. They want something more. They want\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us to say that their behavior is acceptable. They want us not just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to say "whatever works for you," but to say "yes, we agree that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#your behavior is good." Otherwise a civil ceremony would suffice.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Otherwise they would not want it to be in a Church, but would rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reject the Church. But they know that the Church teaches the Truth,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that if the Church were to condone their "marriage," then it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would only then truly be one.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
This in turn reveals something for the rest of us. In their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quest not just for tolerance but for acceptance and endorsement,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the homosexual lobby has provided evidence of the case for absolute\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#truth. Because only in the presence of absolute truth does it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#matter that the Church disapproves of their behavior. Only in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the presence of absolute truth would you need, or care about, your\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#marital status in the eyes of the Church as well as in the eyes of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the civil law.
