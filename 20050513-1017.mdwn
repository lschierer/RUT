As a Native American now heads the park staff for Mount Rushmore,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the presentation moves to include some of the history of broken\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#treaties that liter our westward expansion.[1] The Indians quoted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here are absolutely right, there is a tendency to whitewash that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pattern of expansion, war, treaty, broken treaty that defines that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#era of American History. There is also however, an even stronger\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tendency to whitewash Indian history, to paint it as some green\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#utopia. The reality of that life was *at least* as different\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from the pattern of public perception and public presentation as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Manifest Destiny" was and is. I wonder if they are also teaching\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the tourists and children about the torture and incessant war that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#made up the lives of many tribes. I wonder if they are teaching\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about hunting buffalo by inciting them to stampede over cliffs,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or where cliffs lacked, over gullies where they would break their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#legs (if cliffs, their necks as well). Perhaps they used all of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*a* buffalo, but they killed far more than they needed to get\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that one. I wonder if they are teaching both sides of the wars,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as our soldiers killed entire tribes, and their warriors did the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#same to settlers. For *that* is the true history of that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time, but its not one I think the tribes would like known, they are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#far more happy to simply further the notion that the white man is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#always evil.
