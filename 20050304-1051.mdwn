The WTO now apparently gets to tell *us* what\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#industries we can and cannot subsidize. Don't get me\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wrong, I'm not in favor of farm subsidies at all, but "[US must act\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#'quickly' on cotton](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4317235.stm)" makes my blood boil. It surely is wonderful\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to live a world where an organization accountable to no one and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nothing gets to decide our laws. Even in the days of widespread\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#monarchy, the king was responsible to God, and when he was not,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as with the Romans, look where you ended up. Do we want to go down\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that road? I do not *think* so. We seriously need to start\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#resisting this move towards globalization. It stands in opposition\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, concentrating power and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decision-making into the hands of the unaccountable few rather than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#localizing it to levels where it is under the control and influence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the people who's lives the laws will decide. The United Nations,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the World Court, all\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of these need to go. And the LOST treaty creating a NGO, with the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#power to tax of all things, to cripple the trade of any country that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#defies it, needs to be stopped. It ***must not be allowed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to happen***. We are going downhill fast here, with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the spread of secularization, paganism, and, with them, corruption\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and death. It is no surprise that the United Nations "peace keepers"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are the center of so much scandal; what else do you expect to come\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from a culture that has greater regard for you as a sheep than you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as a thinking sovereign person? "Might makes right" in history and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#politics, as Fr. Lyle used to say, and these soldiers have the might,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#without the moral framework to hold them back. Expect to see more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of this. Expect to see LOST used to redistribute our wealth to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pockets of corrupt dictators in 3rd world countries, supposedly to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fund improvements, development, and aid, but with the same sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#corruption that the Oil for Food program had.
