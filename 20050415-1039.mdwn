I remember that there was once this thing called a legal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#separation, where you were still married, but not living together.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It was tried before divorces, and it better reflected the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#reality of marriage, at least from my Catholic perspective.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Divorce **is** merely a legal separation, you are not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#then unmarried, you are not then able to marry again. You do not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hear about legal separation any more, just divorce. Why is that?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The reason I ask is that in Oregon, have passed a bill to allow for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#divorce when the woman is pregnant. Apparently this was needed to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#protect women in abusive relationships. One would think that there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would be other ways short of divorce to do that, no?
