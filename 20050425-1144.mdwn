[In\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Seminary Halls, All Eyes Are on the Newest Pontiff](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/international/worldspecial2/25priests.html?position=&ei=5088&en=c373d5ebb7f302d8&ex=1272081600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&adxnnlx=1114440231-4HB3Cjc2OBt57nn/vN/BNA) gets on my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#nerves a little bit. Not that the media has things wrong, that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it is trying to stir up controversy, or that it is highlighting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the existing controversy, but that there are seminarians and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#priests out there they can use for quotes and source material.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#These priests are out there, these seminarians will be going out\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#there, and teaching people that contraception is okay, abortion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a personal choice, and that women in the priesthood is just the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Church being slow to change. They will say this despite the clear\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#teaching of the Church being just the opposite. Abortion is evil.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Contraception has lead to the pervasiveness of the culture of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#death, as well as being fundamentally wrong itself. Female clergy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is a theological impossibility. And it is **not**\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the case that the Church is denying women equal rights. This is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not a question of "rights." Just as the Church has not "chosen"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to "deny" you the ability to remarry after a divorce, so also the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Church has not "chosen" to "deny" women the "right" to be ordained.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of marriage or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the priesthood to speak of either in those terms.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Men and women are not the same. They each deserve just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#compensation. They deserve equal access to work, according to their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#abilities (I am sorry ladies, if you cannot lift the heavy suit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cases, you are not a fully functional replacement a guy who can,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*if* you work as a baggage handler.). Whatever might have been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the case before women had franchise, you could not justly deny them\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the vote today. Men and women are "equal" in that regard also.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#However the sexes also differ. As I noted above, *most*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women cannot do the physical work of a man. Employers should be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#allowed to take that into account, though they should also allow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exceptions. If you can't lift (for example) 70 pounds, it is not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sexism to deny you the job. If you are working as a police officer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or firefighter, I sincerely doubt it is fully coincidence that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the police shootings recently have had to do with male criminals\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#taking the weapons away from female cops. Coming back on topic,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Church has taught, consistently, that men alone can be priests.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Jesus broke cultural taboos left and right. He talked to Samaritans,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Samaritan women, lepers, and sinners *of every sort*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If He had wanted female priests, you would see them in the Bible.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And no, Dan Brown's stories simply do not hold up.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Priests who ignore and/or deny this do us no favors. They\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#confuse us, they make issues of things that otherwise would be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fairly clear cut. The push for feminist theology would not be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*nearly* as pervasive if it did not find support from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#priests, who should know better. Communism and socialism would not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be *nearly* as prevalent in Latin America if the liberation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#theology was condemned from the pulpit. In the last century,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Archbishop Oscar Romero learned, as he was elevated in the Church,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that you cannot compromise with evil governments. He was martyred\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for his stand for justice. *But he did so without embarrassing the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#opposite evil*. Our priests must learn from his example, from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the example of our Holy Father John Paul II, who called communism\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#evil, who did so despite an assassination attempt. They must learn\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to lead us according to the Truth again. That way, when we fail,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we will at least know that we have done so, and will at least be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#able to find our way back to God.

**UPDATE 20050426-0802:** Vincas rightly points out that deacons are clergy, and that it was the priesthood alone I was refering to.
