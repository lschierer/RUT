<p>Apparently I have almost never written here about the Second Amendment.  That somewhat surprises me. I was looking at TownHall's "C-log" today, and found <a href="http://www.townhall.com/blogs/c-log/DanMitchell/story/2005/10/20/172128.html" title="Good news for 2nd Amendment supporters">this gem.<sup>[1]</sup></a> Like the one post that a simple search here finds on the topic,<sup><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050406-1141/20050406-1141" title="20050406-1141">[2]</a></sup> it provides facts and figures on the reality of gun control and concealed carry permits.  Worth taking note of.</p>  <font size="-2"> <ol> <li>Mr. Dan Mitchell.
