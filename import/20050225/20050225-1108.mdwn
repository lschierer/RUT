According to "<a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-5589512.html?tag=zdfd.newsfeed">When
paying with plastic, why swipe? Just wave</a>," the credit
card companies are looking at switching from magnetic strips
to RFID tags.  I imagine these will be similar to those
that the State Department wants placed in passports now,
which has significant privacy and security implications.  In "<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/rfid_passports.html">Schneier
on Security</a>" security expert Bruce Schneier addresses some
of the concerns with the RFID tags in passports.  Apparently,
despite government assertions to the contrary, with the right
equipment, these tags will be readable from some some distance
away.  Schneier's report is somewhat misleading from what I have
gathered, he talks about the chips broadcasting continuously,
where I have heard from Andrius that they only do so when they
are powered by a certain radio frequency.  The difference is
slight, but significant to keep in mind when reading the more
official reports on these tags.  Even assuming they need to be
powered by a radio frequency, a directional transmitter/receiver
would be able to read an unshielded passport from sufficient
distance that you would not necessarily know it had been read.
The implications for credit cards are clear.  In an age where credit
cards increasingly do not need a signature (think amazon.com or
other online vendors), someone having your credit card number is
equivalent to that person being able to buy things in your name.  "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/high_tech/1700/2-25-2005/20050225013015_04.html">Potential
ID Theft Victims Eye Information</a>" is simply the most recent
article I have seen about identity theft, there have been many many
others in the past year.  This also goes right back to the concerns
I discussed <a href="./view.php?date=20050216-1611">on Wednesday,
