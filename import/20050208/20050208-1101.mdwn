Score one to those who are fighting for life at all its stages; "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/science/08coma.html?ei=5088&en=fad9f8f8470414a6&ex=1265605200&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">Signs
of Awareness Seen in Brain-Injured Patients</a>" by Benedict Carey
documents a study that discovers that some unresponsive patients
might in fact not be brain dead, but be aware and unable to respond.
This stands to reason, it is logically entirely possible to loose the
ability to control muscles without loosing the ability to receive
input, as the "<a href="http://www.arn.org/eyw.htm">Exercise Your
Wonder</a>" column on <a href="www.arn.org">ARN</a> has documented,
the nerves involved with control and sensation are different,
and brain mapping studies have shown much the same, though they
do not really understand <em>what</em> is going on, they can tell
<em>where</em> the unknown is taking place.  This should have an
interesting effect on cases like that one in Florida where the
parents of a paralyzed woman are fighting to keep her alive over
the objections of her lowlife husband.
