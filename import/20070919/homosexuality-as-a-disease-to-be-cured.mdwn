The study[^200709193] findings were released in book form, not in a journal.  I suspect that means that its findings are useless and meaningless.  Still, a pair of real researchers, working for institutions of higher learning (a college and a university respectively), found a 67% success rate in changing sexual orientation through a program of "group discussions, counseling, journal writing, Scripture reading and prayer."[^200709194]  

However, since it is not in a peer reviewed journal, their effort is wasted, their study might as well not exist.
