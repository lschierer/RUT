Having been told that rap is 90% of the music out there, I wonder what my CCD kids last year would think of the rules at Ave Maria University.<sup><a href="http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2006/aug/29/students_live_stricter_rules_catholic_school/?local_news" title="Students live by stricter rules at Catholic school">[1]</a></sup> ;-)  Not that I think there is much chance that many if any of them would choose to go to Ave Maria, but it would be &#x2026; interesting to see their reaction to the policy.
