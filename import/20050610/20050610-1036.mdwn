<p>I am pleased to see that some 18 countries are possibly going to
be forgiven their debt.[1] I worry some that we (the US taxpayer)
will have to pay it off for them, but we would eventually end
up doing so anyway.  I also wonder under what terms this will
happen, and what all it will entail.  I see from the article that
the countries will have to prove a reduction in corruption and
"improve governing," a phrase that seems awfully ambiguous to me.
Also somewhat disturbing is the blatant expectation that this
simply means these countries will borrow more.  That, I think,
is the last thing they need to be doing.</p>
