In no particular order:
<ul>
<li>The seller agreed to do the repairs.</li>
<li>Andy got all the paper work he needs for our loan application.  No word back yet.</li>
<li>Notified the land lady that I will be moving the last weekend in October.</li>
<li>Worked late four nights out of the last 10-11 business days, only one of which was to make up for time.</li>
<li>Took Mom to her discogram (resulting in the time I had to make up the most recent of those four late days)</li>
<li>Went down to Richmond for a good birthday weekend #1 with Lauren</li>
<li>Just barely started packing</li>
<li>Started over on a work project many times as the requirements changed underneath me.</li>
