"[F]or three Mars summers in a row, deposits of frozen carbon dioxide near Mars' south pole have shrunk from the previous year's size, suggesting a climate change in progress."<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup> As best I recall, this did not make news roughly a year and a half ago.  It is thus semi-remarkable that it was drawn to my attention now.  But it does cast a somewhat more positive light on those scientists who are insisting that global warming is more significantly influenced by solar activity than by human activity.  I would be interested to know what the temperature change is on Mars, and how well it correlates to our own temperature changes.  I would also be curious to know if this warming trend has continued there in the time since this was published.  I am not, however, so curious as to research it myself.
