<p>Mr. Marvin Olasky correctly identifies the line I try to walk between "a woman's place is in the home" and the careerism of today's culture.[1] While I strongly suspect that in trying to articulate the wrongness of today's society I end up sounding like I've gone too far the other way, that is not my intent.  Mr. Olasky correctly points out that today's quota system is wrong, chances are good that <em>most</em> women are called to be a full time mother.  But not all are, and those who are not should not be restricted any more than their own abilities restrict them.  Thus I advocate true and fair strength requirements for jobs requiring physical labor.  Yes, that would bar most women.  But not the few who are truly able to do the work.  And thus women have a place in the laboratory as well, some women are smarter than most men.  But motherhood is not some lesser choice, and our culture is deeply disordered to treat it as such.</p>
