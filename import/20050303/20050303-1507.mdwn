<p> Was the "hobbit" in fact a normal human with a disease? "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4308751.stm">Hobbit
was 'not a diseased human'</a>" has some discussion on this

was an unrefuted explanation for the cave men, which are currently
called Neanderthals, and considered a separate species.</p>
