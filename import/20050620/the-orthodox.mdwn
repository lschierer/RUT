Vincas once told me that the biggest thing holding back reunification with the Orthodox churches was the intransigence of the Russian Patriarch.  Is that the same as the Ukrainian one?  I am assuming not, as today I read that he is advocating working more closely with Rome.<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4173">[1]</a> I would love to see a reunification of the Orthodox churches to the Church.  It would end some confusion, and as importantly, end centuries of people being lead astray by the schism.
