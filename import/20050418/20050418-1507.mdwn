<p> In science news today, "<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/feature_emerging.asp?p=2">
Quantum Wires</a>" talks about using nanotubes for wires.
It says that if they can get macroscopic wires of just one type
of nanotube, they will be able to do superconducting without the
cooling.  Right now when they make macroscopic wires they end up
with all sorts of nanotubes.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally finished <em>Galileo's Mistake</em>.
Really, I finished it last week, as I had all of a page left to
read at lunch today. If I'd realized, as I should have, that the
rest of the book was just index, I would have taken the extra
minute to finish it then.  It is a very good book, and I highly
recommend it.</p>
