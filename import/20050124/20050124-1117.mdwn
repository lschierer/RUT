I'm just starting this, not sure how it will work out. A previous,
flatfile attempt, a few years ago, fell very flat. I'm using some
cobled together php for this rather than a fancy blog package, partly
because of my utter failure to get 2 of them working (I am fairly
hopeless at setting up mysql or postgresql), and partly because I'm
not sure exactly what I want. Certainly nothing with the high overhead
of livejournal. I'm also not certain how public I want this to be. I'm
fairly certain I do <u>not</u> want to be <em>on</em> LiveJournal.
