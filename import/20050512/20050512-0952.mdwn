<p>It is hard to believe the level of arrogance when, right after
discovering a new species, scientists are talking about how this
might be the last such discovery ever.[1] As if they would not
have said a month ago that they would never make such a discovery!
Rather than realizing how little they know, they insist this is
a fluke, they cannot allow there to be even the smallest chink in
their claims of having all the answers.  At least, until the next
time the rain forest is threatened, then they will remember that
there are things out there they have not discovered yet. ;-)</p>
