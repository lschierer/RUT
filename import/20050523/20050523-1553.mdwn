<p>To no one surprise, the American Psychiatric Association, well
known (by me at least) as a source of liberal propaganda, has come
out in support of homosexual "marriages."[1] Last week, Boundless
published an article on marriage, and the competing social views
of it, that I thought hit home particularly well.[2] It proposes
that there are three views of marriage: 1)the traditional model,
based on sexual complementarity and marriage as an institution
2)the choice model, looking at marriage essentially as an agreement
between sovereign selves, and 3)the postmodern, looking at marriage
as a codification of "the 'web of interdependence' that is created
by this interaction with another person."  Only in the second
two does the idea of a homosexual "marriage" make any sense, but
only the first is the basis for a true marriage.  Unfortunately,
even some Catholics have lost track of the fact that marriage is
more than just a social contract, and even more have forgotten or
rejected the concept of the sexes being complementary.</p>
