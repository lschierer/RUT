<p>I find today that schools are increasingly using computer programs
to grade writing assignments.[1] While this would be awesome
if they could get it to work reliably, I fear that like the one
student quoted states, all that students will really learn is how
to beat the system.  Natural language parsers are a notoriously hard
problem to solve, and key word searches are incredibly difficult to
get working well.  While much progress has been made, look at the
evolution of search engines, some of this has been done by avoiding
the problem entirely, google's page rank for instance, specifically
avoids part of the natural language problem by categorizing its
keyword search by the page rank, essentially trusting the collective
judgment of real humans.  Grading an essay is rather more complex
than the incredibly simplistic form of data mining involved in a
search engine.  The computer-grader needs to not only detect the
<em>presence</em> of certain key words, but needs to determine if a
correct relationship has been demonstrated between them, in any of
the various ways a student could word it.  Grammar checking is fairly
straight forward, but even the best spelling dictionaries we have
available to date do not contain a full set of English, including
the jargon specific to the various fields that the high school and
college student will need.  However, while I maintain that grammar
is "fairly straight forward," it is never the less a significantly
difficult problem that it is not unheard of for a human writer
to disagree with them various grammatics <em>and be right</em>.
Thus overall, while I hold hope that this sort of grading might at
some point be feasible, and, to the extent that it is achieved,
does provide a useful service in removing some of the repetition
and drudgery of teaching, I maintain that it is likely a mistake
to deploy it in any sort of unverified (by which I mean a real live
human verifies it came up with a reasonable result) manner.</p>
