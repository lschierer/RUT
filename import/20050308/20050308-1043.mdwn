<p> Phyllis Schlafly's article, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/ps20050307.shtml">Feminists
find no solace in science that disagrees with them</a>," once again
puts me on thin ice.  So this time I am not really going to comment
on it, just recommend you read it.  Warren Farrell's <em>Why Men
Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap and What Women
Can Do About It</em> goes on the to-read list however.</p>
