I recall there being some debate over exactly when an unborn baby begins to feel pain, at what point the nervous system is sufficiently developed to transmit it, and the brain to make sense of the transmissions.  So I expect that this debate<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup> will not go smoothly, and the measure to be hotly contested in congress, and, if it passes, in court.  Still, it is good to see it on the table.
