<p> There is little like a need to refute something
to get ideas moving.  In a reply to Joe Duffy's <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jduffy1535/44743.html">recent
post</a>, I wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>okay, something finally motivated me to take up
Ederlyn's advice to create an account just so I can comment on posts
here. I haven't been incredibly motivated to do so since I've been
using my own home-brew software, which is sufficient to my minimal
needs. anyway. It is incredibly sad how so often the academics here,
even priests, will minimize everything we believe.</p>

<p>secondly, *perhaps* you could claim that, over the course
of 15 years, the feeding tube has become burdensome. But look
at the following: he won a huge settlement 7 or 8 years ago, the
money from which he claimed at the time would go to taking care of
her. to-date, that money has only been used to pay for the lawyer
who is representing his efforts to end her life.[1]</p>

<p>thirdly, say it was burdensome to him. He isn't being asked to
do it, the parents want to take over, to take on guardianship of
her. and her siblings have stepped forward to take over when they
no longer can.</p>

<p>fourth, when he was fighting that law suite, he wanted to keep
her alive. then he got involved with some other woman, and started
a family with her, and all of a sudden his opinions changed, and
he "remembered" that she'd not want to live in that state. a state
she'd been in for a number of years at that point. sound suspicious
to you? it does to me.</p>

<p>fifth. there is evidence from several doctors, from several of
the nurses who work at that hospice, and from the family (except
her husband) to the effect that she can swallow some. no one in
a "persistent vegetative state" can swallow at all. regardless
of whether or not you can understand the tapes of her, it really
doesn't matter: no one in a "persistent vegetative state" can make
even that much noise. why are the courts unwilling to consider
this evidence?</p>

<p>sixth: recently we have several studies showing people in similar
states have drastically different scan results when hearing the
voice of someone they know.[2] but no such test has been done on
Terri. why does the husband not want to let such tests occur?</p>

<p>seventh: we have testimony from people who have been in
"persistent vegetative states" who, though "vegetative" for
considerably less time, unexpectedly improved.[3][4][5][6][others]
why are we not considering that in deciding her case?</p>

<p>mmm. I could probably come up with more points, but that's enough
for now. I've been asking these sorts of questions, as have other
bloggers, for some time now. no one seems to answer them.</p>
