Congress is trying to push through a bill to create federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#funding for embryonic stem cell research.[1] This move comes with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lots of promises of future cures, at the cost of lives, but no\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#results *at all* so far. The promising treatments from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#stem cells to date come from adult stem cells and from umbilical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tube stem cells, neither of which cost a life to obtain. This is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#then thus simply an attempt by materialist and atheist scientists\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to further desensitize to death.
