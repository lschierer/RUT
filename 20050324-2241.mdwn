There is little like a need to refute something\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to get ideas moving. In a reply to Joe Duffy's [recent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jduffy1535/44743.html), I wrote the following:

> okay, something finally motivated me to take up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Ederlyn's advice to create an account just so I can comment on posts\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here. I haven't been incredibly motivated to do so since I've been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#using my own home-brew software, which is sufficient to my minimal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#needs. anyway. It is incredibly sad how so often the academics here,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even priests, will minimize everything we believe.

> secondly, \*perhaps\* you could claim that, over the course\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of 15 years, the feeding tube has become burdensome. But look\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at the following: he won a huge settlement 7 or 8 years ago, the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#money from which he claimed at the time would go to taking care of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her. to-date, that money has only been used to pay for the lawyer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who is representing his efforts to end her life.[1]

> thirdly, say it was burdensome to him. He isn't being asked to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#do it, the parents want to take over, to take on guardianship of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her. and her siblings have stepped forward to take over when they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#no longer can.

> fifth. there is evidence from several doctors, from several of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the nurses who work at that hospice, and from the family (except\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#her husband) to the effect that she can swallow some. no one in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a "persistent vegetative state" can swallow at all. regardless\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of whether or not you can understand the tapes of her, it really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#doesn't matter: no one in a "persistent vegetative state" can make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even that much noise. why are the courts unwilling to consider\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this evidence?
