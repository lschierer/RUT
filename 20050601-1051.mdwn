Intel has started including Digital Rights Management(DRM)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#functionality in their Pentium line of chips.[1] The new Pentium D\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#processor will have functionality that will both tie in with the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Windows DRM functionality, and will also allow administrators to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#remotely administrate machines "independent[ly] of an operating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#system." Can you only imagine having your computer hacked not just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at an operating system level, but at a *firmware* level?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#How would you even detect that? This goes well beyond the fears\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that first awoke with "Secure Computing."
