I learned today that Congressman Henry Hyde has died, and gone to meet his Maker.[\^200711301] Congressman Hyde once either said or wrote (I do not know which)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> When the time comes, as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates, you are there alone standing before God — and a terror will rip your soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there'll be a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world — and they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, ‘Spare him, because he loved us!’[\^200711302]

I pray God that Congressman Hyde finds his rest in Heaven.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200711301]: Ms. Candice Watters.
