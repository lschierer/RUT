I had a very full weekend, and so I was not at my computer much.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#WCACs was Saturday, consuming my day from early (for a Saturday)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#until fairly late (I got home around 8:30-9pm). It was a well\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#spent day, though PVI did not do as well as they could have.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Many of our guys didn't seem to have their heads in the matches,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and our performance reflected that. Still, we had four guys\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in finals, and several more took third. Unfortunately our heavy\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#weight was injured in his final match, I have not heard officially,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hopefully they were mistake, but the trainers think he broke his\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#collar bone, which would put him out for St. Alban's and states.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I have to feel sorry for both him and the team. Michael did well,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but not great. He lost his first match, in which he could have done\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#better, won his second match decisively, and then lost his third.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He lost to the wrestlers who took first and third respectively,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but my impression, having wrestled myself, having watched my team,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#William and his team, and now Michael and his team, is that Michael\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#could have won at least one of those, especially that match against\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Good Council (the first one).   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Sunday I went to St. Veronica's 10:15am mass. I must say that it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is nice being able to leave at approximately 10:05 and get their at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#10:13, though I am aware that this is not something to depend on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(I didn't hit a red light at the Fairfax County Parkway), and I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would of course like to get there earlier most of the time anyway.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It is also nice to have an instructive homily. Many times you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are confronted with the seeming dichotomy between sequestering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#your faith from the sight of others and being "Holier than thou"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(as my Mom would say), the kind of person who no one much likes who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#may or may not live their faith well, but who, regardless, tries to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#push their faith in your face. It is an easy trap to fall into,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on either side. Addressing the side that is, I think, more of a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#danger for me, we are called to be missionaries, to work for the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conversion of others, we **must** be demonstrative in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our faith, people around us **must** know that we are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Catholic, and our lives ***must*** be such that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they will be drawn towards that faith. Fr. Pollard (spelling?) gave\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some advice on threading that needle. We must do what is required\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for our own welfare, praying before meals, even in restaurants,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and even when around people who wouldn't. We need not pray aloud.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We must provide for the needs of those dependent on us, parents must\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#share their experience with God enough to provide a concrete example\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for their children not just of ritual and tradition, but of life and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the meaning of faith in it. Beyond that, we must attempt to gage\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the effects. What will be more effective at drawing people to God,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will the overt display put them off, if so hold back, or will it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cause them to question, to speak, if so let them see.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Later Sunday I went to Chris and John's Super Bowl Party. I haven't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ever done this before, I haven't even *watched* football in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ages, almost certainly not since my father died. I do not know\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that I would go again. I was strongly reminded of why I dislike\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#football. It is such a pointless game at a professional level.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And seems so silly to me as a wrestler anyway. I know that there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are, must be people, who feel the same way about wrestling, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#emotions are nothing if not subjective. I am reminded of the times\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#football players have attended their first wrestling practice.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#None of them has found themselves prepared by the fall season of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#football for the rigors of wrestling, even though a football game\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is *much* longer than a wrestling match. And the difference\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in practice is not in vain, the wrestling match, I have been told,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even by a good football player, requires more in 6 minutes than the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#football game does. Regardless, football strikes me as a bunch\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of "dumb jocks" (intentionally invoking the stereotype) slamming\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#into each other with occasional displays of skill (some running\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and catching, some throwing contain skill). The displays that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#players create only serve to reinforce this position. The dancing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#after a touch down or a good play especially seems out of place,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#excessive, crass. Wrestling is not entirely immune from this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#after a pin, you will often see arms raised in victory, a bellow as\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#emotion is released. It is to some extent inherent in competitive\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#personalities, and so I think it is the excess and silliness\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the football display that disgusts, not its presence alone.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Let us not forget, also, that the wrestling match begins and ends\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with a hand shake, wrestlers are required to walk onto and off of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the mat as gentlemen, and few football players appear to attempt\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be gentlemen. It is interesting as a side note that we respect\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less the DeMatha wrestlers, who do not meet our (PVI's) standards,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as compared to other schools we wrestle, even though DeMatha is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unquestionably one of the very best, and consistently one of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#very best, schools we wrestle.
