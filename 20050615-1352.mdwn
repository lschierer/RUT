Mr. Robert Novak provides some details on the Kyoto accords that I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had not previously heard.[1] I have been against this treaty simply\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because I think it is utterly misguided. From what I gather, it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does not seem that we *can* undo the damage of global warming\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that we have done so far, whatever amount of damage is our fault.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The push then seems to be couching a desire to minimize future\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#damage in terms of preventing inevitable catastrophe. This seems\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wrong-headed. If the catastrophe is coming, we should push forward\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as best we can to have the technology on hand to survive it.

Mr. Novak asserts that this treaty is about more than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#environmentalism however. If he is right, it is also an explicit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#attempt to use environmentalism to cause Americans to accept a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decrease in our standard of living. This causes a blip in my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#radar screen because it was one of the things that was predicted\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the Federal Reserve book that I never finished. It had some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#kooky Lockness Monster type name. Anyway, one of the ideas of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#part of the book that I did read was that various situations would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be used not to raise the third world up to first world lifestyles,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but to level the playing field by bring *down* the average.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Were this to actually happen, it would not surprise me to see it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#coming with heavy European and Chinese pressures, as these are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#socialist and communist governments already. I am not saying\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the book is right, just that this sort of tendency bears\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#watching.
