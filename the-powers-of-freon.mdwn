#+TITLE: the powers of freon

Yesterday the air conditioning service guy recharged the freon in the air handler here at the office. Today for the first time in \*MONTHS\*, it is \*cold\* here at the office. At least upstairs. There is a nine degree difference between up here and down by the thermostat (colder up here) and another nine degree difference when you go into the server room.
