The USCCB has launched an initiative to try to change public\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#opinion, or at least Catholic opinion, on immigrants.[1] Immigrants\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#help our country and society in a number of ways, from doing the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hard jobs, to enriching our culture (on a superficial note, would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we have the wealth of food types without them?). The bishops are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#highlighting the problems in the immigration system, from bias\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#against them among us, to the difficulty getting into this country,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a difficulty that some claim causes the illegal immigration.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Additionally, the ID mess strikes immigrants particularly hard.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We use the same few IDs (birth certificate, drivers license, social\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#security number) for pretty much everything, and an immigrant can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have trouble getting providing these things.
