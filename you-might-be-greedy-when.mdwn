You cut back production because, even though your profits are still very high, they are no longer record breaking.^[[1]](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/51ec2e78-40da-11db-827f-0000779e2340.html\ "Opec\ concerned\ over\ falling\ oil\ prices")^ Even worse, they are talking about it being a problem if oil were to drop to or below $50/barrel. If $67/barrel translates to gas prices at $2.70/gallon, then OPEC needs some serious revision in their view of reality. Though I remain unsure how much of that is OPEC and how much the gas companies when I see that Iowa has gas prices as low as *$2.05*/gallon.^[[2]](http://www.iowastategasprices.com/\ "IowaStateGasPrices.com")^ Either way, it is totally insane.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
