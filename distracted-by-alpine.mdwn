#+TITLE: Distracted by Alpine

Spent some time today trying to get alpine's webmail component up and running. I am pleased to see that the authors of pine are coming out with a webmail that should work with my maildir setup.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, at the same time, I ought not to have worked on it just now. I need to find some time to work on the Gaim -\>Pidgin change for the 1.5.1 tree. I had hoped to make significant progress on it today, but did not. Alpine was a more interesting project, as necessary as the name change is.
