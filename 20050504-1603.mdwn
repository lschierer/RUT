Cal Thomas [is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#upset](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/calthomas/ct20050502.shtml) that we are not to torture terrorist suspects or captured\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#terrorists. He says that the "greater good" of saving thousands or\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#perhaps millions of lives justifies it. Apparently he is not aware\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the long standing judicial tradition of preferring to let guilty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#men go free rather than unjustly imprisoning (much less torturing)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#one innocent man. He is also apparently unaware that the ends do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not *ever* justify the means.
