Last week Chris sent me an article talking about the use of
encryption in the Revolutionary War and colonial periods.[^1] Turns
out that various encryption methods were very well known and quite
widespread for government, business *and interpersonal*
correspondence.  So wide spread was the use of encryption, that the
courts "have not treated those persons who have used encryption,
ciphers, and codes with any presumption of illegality."[^2]
In criminal cases, "evidence that a defendant used a cipher
or encryption has been allowed (as in United States v. Burr) as
proof of the means used to commit an illegal act, but as proof of
an illegal act by itself."[^3] This is significant to remember in
light of a Minnesota case where the existence of a PGP encryption
program on the defendant's computer was deemed evidence, by both
the trial court and the appellate court, of criminal intent.[^4]

A caveat here: The crime the defendant is accused of is horrific,
and if guilty, he should be locked up for life with no chance
of parole.

Still, it is disturbing to see that an encryption program, with
no evidence of encrypted files, or its use in any way related to the
crime, is evidence that you intend to break the law.  There are any
number of good reasons to use PGP, or its free clone, GPG, beyond
illegal activities.  For instance, many open source packages come
with GPG signatures to help prevent a man in the middle attack
from substituting a modified version of the package either in
the mirror you are downloading from, or via a transparent proxy.
Similarly, PGP/GPG signatures are used to verify identity in email
correspondence, and, just as it was in the colonial period and
the early days of the country, used to encipher perfectly legal,
but personally sensitive information to protect it from friends,
family, neighbors, and random people out on the Internet who should
not be reading it.  It is disturbing to see how quickly after finding
such research, I see confirmation that it is indeed necessary to
have it.
