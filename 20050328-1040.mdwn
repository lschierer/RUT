According to [feedvalidator.org](http://feedvalidator.org/), it seems\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that pretty much everything except some of the &s in urls and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the <p\> tags are acceptable. This pleases me, as the hack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of including html when I should not was somewhat distressing. The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sample is fairly representative, with some html entities, and some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the formatting tags I commonly use. So it seems I should look\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for something to replace my use of <p\>, but I doubt I actually\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will.
