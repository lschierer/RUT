#+TITLE: Dawkins stumbles

Periodically when I follow the RSS link to Dr. Mike Adams' articles, I end up somewhere else. This time, I read the entire article before I realized it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It seems that Dr. Dawkins has again accepted an invitation to debate a theist. This time, it further appears that he tried to rig the debate, and deny his opponent a real opportunity to refute his theory. Picking a columnist with this hope proves to be foolish. Mr. Dinesh D'Souza shows how Dr. Dawkins stumbled in thinking that Mr. D'Souza would not have a chance to refute his (Dr. Dawkins') poor logic.[\^20090301-1] Dr. Dawkins excuse is probably that as this happened on Al-Jazeera, and not a more reputable news source, his slip will be missed.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^20090301-1]: Mr. Dinesh D'Souza.
