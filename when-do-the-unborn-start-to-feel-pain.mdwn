#+TITLE: When do the unborn start to feel pain?

What would you consider to be the more definitive proof that someone feels pain? That they move away from the source of the pain, or that they happen to have what scientists think are the brain structures necessary? If a person moves away from a painful sensation, and has the hormone changes that the rest of us experience when we feel pain, would you not conclude that the person is feeling pain? Apparently not. Apparently, you would conclude that this evinces a reflex action and not an indication that they are actually feeling pain"[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/24/AR2005082400661_pf.html) at all. In the Post article, it is clear that the concern is that proposed Federal legislation that would require mothers be notified that their baby may feel pain while killed, and offering anesthesia, might deter some women from having abortions. A related article in the BBC focuses instead on the increased risk the abortion would pose to the mother if anesthesia is used.[[2]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4180592.stm) Fr. Pavone offers a very different take on it.[[3]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4707) After mentioning that this study contradicts all of those done in the last 15 years on the subject (something the other two articles ignore), he reminds us that if this were a question about someone outside the womb, we would easily and universally recognize that there are painful and painless ways of killing someone, but with the possible exception of capital punishment, all of them are wrong.[[4]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4707) The same holds true of the unborn.
