#+TITLE: The  Incredible Hulk & Batman

I see looking back that I never said anything other than the fact that there have been a lot of good movies out this summer, and that I enjoyed the Indiana Jones movie. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We went to see the Incredible Hulk back when it was still in normal theaters. I very much enjoyed it, even more so than I have the previous Hulk movie. I look forward to sequels. ☺\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The newest Batman movie was certainly very different. I do not at all regret going. It was a little more disturbing than I like to see in a Batman movie though, and I hope they brighten things up for the next one. True to the comic books though it no doubt is, I also dislike seeing Rachel die. ☹
