I've talked about the Connecticut case involving\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Eminent Domain [at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#least once before](.view.php?date=20050222-1237). Jacob Sullum's recent article, "[Can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Supreme Court stop the spread of blight?](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jacobsullum/js20050225.shtml)" neatly summarizes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the issues involved and why I'm opposed to this use of Eminent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Domain. He also reminds the reader of the limitations we no longer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have on this sometimes legitimate government power; limitations that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would ensure that its use is in fact legitimate. Unfortunately,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from reading this article, it appears that the US Supreme Court has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not or will not find this use of Eminent Domain unconstitutional.
