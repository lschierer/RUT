Have you ever considered the idea that a patriarchy might not always be a misogynistic society noteworthy primarily for male tyranny? Mr. Mark Adams refers to an article that argues just this in his latest post to "Friday Fax."^[[1]](http://www.thefactis.org/default.aspx?control=ArticleMaster&aid=1493&authid=11\ "Demographer\ Says\ Religious,\ Cultural\ Conservatives\ on\ the\ Rise")^ According to him, this article is in a magazine called "Foreign Policy," I would like to read it (the article), I wonder if it is freely available online?
