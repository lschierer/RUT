<p>"That previous attempts have failed I attribute to the overall correctness of our own vision of the needs of the community so far."</p>

<p>I randomly browsed over here from Google Talk's website and then XMPP.  I have to say that your statement above is rather bold, and illogical at best.  The time, effort, and community building required to produce a successful open source project, while initially related to "correctness", once established, no longer are tied to being "correct".  Pidgen is a perfect example.  Since you have established the project, you no longer must do what is "correct", and are free to fragment your community instead of finding a compromise.  As you have noted though, community fragmentation is generally undesirable and hinders progress when it causes a project to lose critical mass.</p>
