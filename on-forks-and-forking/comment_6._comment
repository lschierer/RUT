<p>I've not commented on the protocol icons yet, but I have stayed with GAIM and not upgraded to Pidgin because I <em>do</em> find a use for them.</p>

<p>The different protocols do not all work the same, at least as far as offline messaging.  I need to know which of my contacts are on which protocol so I know what they are dealing with and why messages are sent in a particular way.</p>

<p>A simple color-coded system doesn't work too well for me.  This was the case when I still used Trillian.  The way protocol icons were usually handled there was through a user-submitted skin.</p>

<p>"Users claim that they want the protocol icons. I call on them to put their money where their mouth is, by spending the time and effort necessary to become an open source programmer..."</p>

<p>I'm a husband and father of 2.  Being disabled, I do have some time on my hands, but I'm just struggling with simple HTML as it is!</p>

<p>"Others have failed to fully take advantage of Pidgin’s capabilities, and once they realize the power of the “contacts” pidgin supports, realize that most if not all of their desire for protocol icons is removed."</p>

<p>Please see what I said before.  It's been something that has consistently been convenient and useful for me.  I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.</p>

<p>I looked over Psi and Coccinella and had difficulty finding where it said protocol icons were supported.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've no problem trying to help create a plugin for protocol icons if that's a viable solution, but see, not <em>everyone</em> using open source programs is ready to be a programmer.  I'm sorry to hear that people have been childish, impatient, and rude in their demands to have them back-- I hope I have stated my preferences intelligently and maturely.</p>
