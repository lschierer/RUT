<p>I'm a tad confused, does "advertising a fork" mean they were asking other to fork it or were they saying, "we've forked it, join us url:here"?</p>

<p>If the latter, I'd be interested to know the URL (though I'm one of those who agrees with the protocol icon decision) . . .</p>

<p>BTW: the OpenID login box in your blog is black text on black</p>
