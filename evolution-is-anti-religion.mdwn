#+TITLE: Evolution is anti-religion

Periodically I get challenged on my repeated assertion that Evolution, to the (limited) extent it can be called a single theory, is inherently opposed to theism. Mr. Casey Luskin is here today to back me up on this one, having taken the time to summarize some recent examples of this.[\^200709191] Such statements as these lend credence to my assertion that evolution is not, in fact, a scientific theory at all, but is rather a philosophical one. His examples come from *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *Nature*, *Cell Cycle*, *Microbe Magazine*, and *Gene*. They also come from a variety of authors. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This listing of examples is short, and is by no means definitive proof. Still, it \*does\* lend at least some credence. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200709191]: Mr. Casey Luskin.
