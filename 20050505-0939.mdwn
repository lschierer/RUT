Yesterday, Pat Buchanan [wrote an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=44112) that basically boils down to isolationism. North Korea,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Iran, so on and so forth, are not primarily our problem, let China,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Israel, Japan, so on and so forth, handle it since no one wants\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to help or work with us. It is of course tempting. Would it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#work though? I tend to think it would not. Our commitments to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Japan and Taiwan aside, the last time we tried isolationism,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Europe ended up in World War II, Japan bombed us, and we ended\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up fighting in both hemispheres. That is not a history I would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#describe as a particularly successful attempt at letting others\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#handle their own problems. On the other hand, our own record of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#success is not too great either. While we did essentially end\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#World War I and World War II, we also set up Iraq, which we now\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#had to take apart and are putting back together *again*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We failed in Vietnam, and North Korea is not exactly going "well,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#now is it? Lets not mention dropping the ball in China back at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the end of World War II, or Cuba back when we had a chance to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#buy it. Just think of all the problems both might have saved.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I asked Vincas what he thinks of this article yesterday, and more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or less got a non-answer, I think because he had to leave for work.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I should ask Ederlyn and Joe about it.
