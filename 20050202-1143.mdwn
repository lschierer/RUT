\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[Utah\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Amending Gay-Marriage Ban Problems](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-1-2005/20050201111503_09.html)  
 Bad news: Utah's ban\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on Gay Marriages might cause trouble for custodial grandparents.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Good news: it causes problems for people who live together but do\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not marry. Bad news: Utah thinks that's a problem.   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[Conn.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Execution Highlights 'Syndrome'](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-1-2005/20050201111503_20.html)  
 I don't know what to make\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of this one. Death row is apparently depressing. So much so, that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some people sentenced to death are giving up on possible appeals\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because they think they would rather die than face life on death row.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Part of me thinks this is horrid. How much of this atmosphere is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because they are facing execution? How much of it is because they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are facing their crimes? The former is unjust, the latter is just.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I'd rather they not be executed, I tend to think we *could*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#incarcerate them for life, and, if so, that would be a morally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#preferable sentence. I think it would be more just also; let them\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sit in jail, freedom and luxury proscribed, and face the horror\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they brought into the world. Deny them the escape they think death\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will give them. Let them have the chance to purge their guilt\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#here on earth than in the hereafter. Of course, if we persist in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#saying that "life in prison" is 40 years, then we have a problem.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In that case, perhaps the death penalty is still needed. In which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#case we have a different problem, this type of thing will be used\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to release people who should not be released. All very complex.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I don't know what to make of it, other than there is precious little\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is good about it.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[Fatherhood\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#faces stacked deck in family court](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/ps20050131.shtml)  
 An insightful look\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#into the ways in which we deny fatherhood, its rights, and its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#responsibilities. A look into the ways in which the Supreme Court\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#decisions affirming fatherhood are being evaded. Proof, if more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#were needed, of the problems we introduce by allowing divorce,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#especially no fault divorce. Proof, if more were needed, that for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#men, for certain crimes, we are not "innocent until proven guilty,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and that our understandable, laudable, urge to protect the victimized\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has caused great injustice. We need to remember that people are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fallen, that original sin is real. We need to remember that not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#every accusation of abuse, sexual, physical, verbal, whatever,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in a marriage or outside of one, is true. That there are good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#men falsely accused, good teachers falsely accused. Men, women,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and children who will make any assertion, however false, to get\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some petty revenge. That there are twisted people who go into\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#psychology and social work not out of love for their fellow man,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but to use their authority to enact their own revenge against the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#human race. Which is not to say that such are the only people\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#who go into these fields. Maybe they aren't even the majority.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But they do great harm.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[Focus\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on Freedom of Information](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/marktapscott/mt20050131.shtml)  
 Criminals have rights,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is a given. Those rights must be protected. That is also\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a given. People have rights whether they are citizens or not.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That is yet still a given. They also have responsibilities.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That *should* be a given. But when people fail to live up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to their responsibilities, it is reasonable to expect that their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#rights should then be curtailed, to protect those around them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#People who are not citizens here should not be allowed to go free\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to continue their illegal presence here, especially not after having\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#committed further crimes. The failure of the Federal Government to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#deport them is indeed a significant failure, and Mark Tapscott is,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think, justly upset.
