Lots and lots of non-news in my scan today. I am starting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to think that I have once again exhausted my ability to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#significantly interested in national or world events. Still,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a few things did catch my eye. Why is it that people get this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#idea that you must prioritize the world's problems and ignore\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#anything that is not at the top of that stack? Just because\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#China and North Korea are worse than we are, is that reason to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ignore evidence of persecution of faith and Christianity here?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Some attacking Mr. David Limbaugh's book *Persecution* seem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to think so.[1] In the afore-referenced interview, Mr. Limbaugh\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#presents an interesting idea that I have no ability to evaluate:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the systematic persecution of the Faith and of the Jewish\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people in Germany, and in other societies, was presaged by the types\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of miss-characterization that Christians suffer now. Certainly Germany\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#started slow, but is this a fair charge to make? I do not know.

Still, it is worth noting that we *are* slowly but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#surely eroding our understanding of "Freedom of Religion." From the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#suppression of displays of faith in public, we now move to sheltering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#our children from religions that a judge deems not "mainstream."[2]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is a ruling that I cannot but find sympathy for. The rise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Wiccans and others calling themselves witches is disturbing.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It makes me wonder how much of the talk of the "Black Church" in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mr. Neil Stephenson's "Baroque Cycle" is historical, something I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was and am not otherwise inclined to give him much credence in.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Still, as in the case of the New Mexico church that wanted to use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the hallucinogenic tea in their services, I cannot but find this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sort of suppression unacceptable. No government official should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have the right to define what is and is not a religion, what does\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and does not deserve First Amendment protection. I am not sure how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cults should be treated, such bodies that mimic religion present\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a thorny question for law. I know, instinctively, however, that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this sort of action can only spell ill for the Church.
