Just a short note, I just read the latest installment of [*Exercise Your Wonder*](http://www.arn.org/eyw.htm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#by Dr. Howard Glicksman over at [Access\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Research Network](http://www.arn.org/), a nice repository of some Intelligent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Design papers, books, and other resources. I highly recommend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Dr. Glicksman's articles for anyone who actually wants to think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#about exactly what materialistic science claims has evolved.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Dr. Glicksman presents a compelling case that the human body is a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#highly complex and inter-dependent construct, and challenges you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to **think** "could this really have evolved?". Most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people I find do not want to really think. They want to believe what\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they are taught and told by "authorities" (scientists in this case).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And it doesn't help that so much of the response against intelligent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#design comes in the form of attacks against the authors (that keep\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them out of the main-stream journals), and over simplification of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their arguments. Its fairly easy to get people to dismiss 7 day\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#creation, and if you can keep people thinking that the choice is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#between that or evolution, then the argument is pretty much over. :-(
