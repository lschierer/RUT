<p>Not really. I mean, it helps some, it tells me that there is, in fact, theological significance to the difference, but it leaves me confused as to what that difference is.</p>

<p>I suppose this wouldn't matter if the original translation had been accurate, but as it stands, people are going to ask why it is changing, and what the new response means.  When they do, I am still more or less unable to effectively respond.</p>

<p>It says that the greeting is an allusion to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the celebrant.  But to reply "And with your Spirit" seems an awkward way to bring that idea home.  Does the Holy Spirit need us to state that God's peace is with God?  More to the point, since the Mass is for us and not for God (Who needs nothing), does it help us to state that reality in that way?</p>

<p>I am left feeling that I am missing something.</p>
