[[!meta title="Malfoy Family"]]

Unlike the Longbottom family, there is a slight indication that the Malfoy
family might actually be ennobled.  While I see no indication of it in the books,
Mrs. Rowling's Pottermore writings talk about them getting a "prime piece of
land" for services to the King,[^210330-3] something that probably came with a
title.  Since they apparently continued (per the same page) to be high class
socialites through the passage of the Statute of Secrecy,[^210330-4] it seems
unlikely that they lost that title in the various periods of civil unrest
between the Norman conquest and the Statute's division of society into magical
and non-magical cultures.  They seem to have been influential with government
leaders, but not actually part of the magical government, ever
since.[^210330-5]

On a side note, "Malfoy" is essentially "Bad faith" in French.  I highly doubt
that Mrs. Rowling intended this to have any real meaning except foreshadowing the
role that the family would play.  It would, however, be incredibly fun if it
*did* have meaning.  In a world where Astoria Greengrass can have a hereditary
curse,[^210421-1] this should certainly be possible.  Considering that French
was a fairly well known language in the upper classes, I cannot imagine that the
name "Bad faith" did the Malfoy family any good mixing with the upper crust of
either society.  Sure they may have kept it out of stubborn pride, but it is much
more fun to imagine they had no choice but to keep the name.[^210421-2]

Interestingly, based on the timelines I can piece together, Abraxus Malfoy
should have been alive for most if not all of the first war.[^210816-1] At
least, I can find no indication that he himself was a known death
eater,[^210816-2] or that he died before Lucius graduated school.[^210816-3]

[^210816-3]: I cannot exactly document a negative for this one.

    It says *his son* was notorious.  If Abraxus had died in a raid, or gone to
    trial at all, or even been arrested and let off, I think it would say he was
    notorious.

[^210421-1]: As best I can tell, Astoria's illness comes from the abominable
    play that was written as a sequel to the books.  I refuse to actually
    consider that cannon, but am using it here to highlight that my fiction is
    inherently compatible with Mrs. Rowling's creations.
