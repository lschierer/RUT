---

Harry is now in Year 6, his final year of Primary School.  The FSSP priest
cannot put Harry in a normal RCIC class: 1) Harry is a nephil, not a human 2)
the Dursleys will not consent, 3) he is no more successful at engaging the local
ACPCs[^20210604-8] than Harry has been.  He is educating Harry on Catholicism
and about the magical world, but from the Church's perspective.  The Church
never signed the [[International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy|Harry_Potter/Notes/Culture]] (ISWS),
but does mostly tacitly obey it and keep things quiet/secret.  As a result
though, the Church knows far more about the magical world than anyone magical
would suspect, in some cases more than they know about themselves.  

*For the story to work, Harry must not be baptised until sometime after he
starts [[Hogwarts|Notes/Hogwarts]].*  This can thus cover Year 6, but no formal
conversion.  Like Chesterton, Harry must delay his conversion for some time
after he has converted in his thinking.
