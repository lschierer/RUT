<p>This week I have been trying to get GNOME to sit up and
realize that changing from focus theft to pop-under is less than
ideal.[2][3][4][5] After a somewhat rocky start,[1] I finally seem
to be making progress.  This pleases me not only for the narcissistic
reasons, but because it really will make a difference to our users.
For all I am more than willing to utterly disregard the opinions
and reports of demanding and/or annoying users, I <em>do</em> care
about the success of Gaim, and <em>do</em> want the Linux users'
experiences with it to be as pleasant as possible.  That is why I
have gone along with things like slashing preferences even though
it is not always defaulting in ways I like.  Still, it is very
frustrating to deal with these GNOME guys.  They are so convinced
that it is absolutely essential to usability that the focused window
not be obscured&#x2026;</p>
