<p> I see that Rigoberta Menchu is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4332925.stm">in
the news again</a>.  I wonder if her allegations of racism
are more truthful than her autobiography is.  It was an
assigned reading for one of my college courses, and shortly
afterwords (unfortunately just as the semester ended), I
found a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>
article and a <a href="http://www.boundless.org">Boundless</a>
article that references it.  You can find the Boundless article <a href="http://www.boundless.org/1999/departments/isms/a0000074.html">here</a>,
but the New York Times one is older than its archives system
allows you to get at for free.  Basically, the Times exposes her
autobiography as being almost entirely fraudulent.  She did have
a good education, her brothers were not killed by either poverty
or government troops (she states that one died of malnutrition and
one was buried alive), her family was not intimidated and oppressed
by wealthy land owners.  She made it all up, and got a Nobel Peace
Prize for it.  If I were the judge or on the jury in her current
case, I would have significant concerns about her credibility.
Would you?</p>
