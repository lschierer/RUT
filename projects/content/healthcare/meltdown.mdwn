#In the US
* This is only a potential for meltdown, not an actual example of it.  Still, Mr. Smith reminds us that a government program can only be sued for making bad calls if it chooses to let you.[^20120920-1]

#In England
* The United Kingdom has found that its medical system has been rationing care solely on the basis of age.[^20121020-1]  Now yes, they have *just now* passed some sort of ban on the practice, but such is the state of the medical system pending the implementation of that ban - if it is both enforceable and enforced.
* The above ban aside, "GPs have been asked to select one in every 100 of their patients to go on a list of those likely to die over the next 12 months."[^20121020-2]
* Children and babies being dehydrated to death.[^20121223-1]  They take days to die, with severe suffering, after their parents are coerced.  Some, if they regain access to food and water, even survive, demonstrating that not all were untreatable.  
* Some patients have taken to drinking from flower vases to get the water nurses will not give them.[^20130805-1]
* Patients experiencing unnecessary waits.[^20130709-1]
