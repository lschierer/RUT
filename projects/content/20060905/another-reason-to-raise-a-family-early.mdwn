Children grow increasingly more likely to have autism as the father grows older.<sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5313874.stm" title="BBC NEWS | Health | Older fathers 'raise autism risk'">[1]</a></sup>  From this, the fact that autism is growing more common makes sense.  It also follows that autism would be linked to more inteligent parents, who are more likely to have wanted to develop a career before starting their family.
