<p> Judge James D. Whittemore of Federal District Court in
Tampa Florida refused to order Mrs. Schiavo's feeding tube.
He thinks that the parents did not, perhaps could not,
prove a significant likelihood of wining further court
battles, a likelihood they apparently have to prove to
get a temporary order from the Judge.  I am mostly seeing <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050322/D8902I400.html">this</a>
AP News article linked to,
perhaps because it does not require registration.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/national/22cnd-schiavo.html?ei=5088&en=7a3189f284e34074&ex=1269147600&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">This</a>
NY Times article has the most details
on the federal court's decision though, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A55137-2005Mar21?language=printer">this</a>
Washington Post article has more background on why she is
said to be in a "persistent vegetative state."  I cannot help
but note that the details in the Post article are rather more
restricted than the details in the lawyer's writeup that I linked
to <a href="./view.php?date=20050321-1431">yesterday</a>.
The Post describes her interaction as being restricted
to facial expression, but the lawyer has her responding
audibly if not really intelligibly as well.  I also rather
question the use of the person's ability to track visually
and respond to commands as the sole criteria of consciousness,
especially after having read Mr. Chuck Colson's article, posted <a href="./view.php?date=20050316-1004">here</a>.  Michelle Malkin <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001825.htm">continues</a>
to track this, and her sources do not rate the odds of success very
highly. <big>&#x2639;</big></p>
