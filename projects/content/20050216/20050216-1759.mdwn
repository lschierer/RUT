The <a href="http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/subst/fx/help/how-we-know.html/104-6176201-5722335">Amazon
Honor System&#x2122;</a> appears to be Amazon's attempt to compete
with PayPal&#xae;.  It is very disconcerting to see my name on
some random site.  Still, it appears to be cool, Amazon claims
they aren't telling the site operator who visits their page,
and that unlike everything else they do (which they track), they
are not even tracking what sites that use this system you visit!
I'm not sure how much I believe that last, but they do put it in
writing so perhaps it is true.
