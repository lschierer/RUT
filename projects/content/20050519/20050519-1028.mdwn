<p>As cool as the implications of sending tactile information over
the Internet may be, I find it rather more than simply "eccentric"
to develop a human-poultry interaction system.[1] It is quite frankly
bizarre and disturbing.  What happened to the good old days when we
did our research with cats and dogs and other mammals?  Who in their
right mind would want to pet a chicken (except maybe a child)?</p>

<p>Still, as it develops, some of the other applications, such as
helping people learn to dance, or interacting with other people,
or even interacting with a guard dog, are interesting.  It will be
interesting to see this area of research develop.</p>
