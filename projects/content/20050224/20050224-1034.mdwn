This is rather interesting, apparently they
have software now that approaches translating by
learning from the efforts of other translators.  "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7054">Software
learns to translate by reading up</a>" talks about this development.
This sort of learn from experience approach works exceptionally
well at recognizing spam, which I realize is not quite related,
but it is the same sort of language recognition problem that the
traditional hard coded rule sets have been failing at.  It will be
interesting to see how well this sort of thing works.
