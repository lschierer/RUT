<p> David Limbaugh's "<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/more_thoughts_o.html#more">More
Thoughts on Schiavo</a>" helps to bring into focus what part of
the legal battles we have seen is objectionable and what parts are
less so.  He rightly reminds us that not all poor decisions are
judicial activism.</p>

<p>Donald R. May's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GuestColumns/May20050321.shtml">Terri's
Case -- It's All About Money, Power, and Our Constitution</a>"
is also very worth reading.  He reminds me of "<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050213/D887B94G0.html">Brain-Damaged
Woman Talks After 20 Years</a>," the case of a brain
damaged woman who suddenly regained the ability to
speak after <em>20 years</em>.  He also points out <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/nat1182.html">Study Reveals Disabled
Patients Like Terri Schiavo Show Awareness</a>."  I <em>think</em>
that I have seen something along these lines somewhere else, but
I am unsure.  Regardless, it is a remarkable example of the limits
of simply having some strange doctor talk to a patient and expecting
the patients eyes to be able to track the doctor.  There is much more
to awareness than just your ability to react in visible ways.</p>

<p>Mr. Limbaugh has, in his post above, come to the point where he
is starting to understand how a relative of Mrs. Schiavo might be
tempted to resort to illegal measures to save her life at this point.
My mom reached that point rather more quickly, her personality is
like that.  I myself cannot say she is wrong, I do not believe it
can be right to accept a wrong such as this.</p>
