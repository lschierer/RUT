I found "<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20050211/ap_on_re_us/recovering_woman">Kan.
Woman Resumes Talking After 20 Years</a>" from
<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/">David
Limbaugh's blog</a> post entitled "<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/02/the_mysteries_o.html">The
Mysteries of Life</a>."  He made the same association I would have
myself on reading the article, that it is remarkably similar to the
findings I mentioned <a href="./view.php?date=20050208-1101">here</a>
in which there are some signs that even unresponsive patients are
still aware of their surroundings.  Just goes to show you once again,
that we need to be <strong>incredibly</strong> wary not to devalue
human life at any stage or in any condition, but rather always give
God room and time to choose to act.
