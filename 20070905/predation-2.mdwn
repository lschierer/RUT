<blockquote markdown="1">In The Gay Report, by homosexual researchers Karla Jay and Allen Young, the authors report that 73% of homosexuals surveyed had at some time had sex with boys 16 to 19 years of age or younger. Dr. Paul McHugh, former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, calls a report of the John Jay Criminal College a “bombshell.” John Jay found that the Catholic abuse crisis wasn’t pedophilia but “homosexual predation on American Catholic youth.”[^200709051]</blockquote>

All the child safety programs in the world are useless if we, and they (the programs), do not confront this fact.  Will excluding homosexuals from the priesthood alone solve the problem? No, clearly not.  Not *every* instance of abuse by priests was an example of homosexual predation.  However, many of them no doubt were just that.  This is why so many of the victims were young men and boys.  If an end to celibacy were the cure, you would expect that most of the victims would be female, not male.
