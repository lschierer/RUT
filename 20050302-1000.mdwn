Pat Buchanan has been off his rocker\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#frequently of late, but his most recent column, "[A\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#republic, not a democracy](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43106)," has some good points in it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the second half or so. We are **not**\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a democracy, and are not one for a good reason. [FIRE](http://www.thefire.org/) has been documenting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and fighting the tyranny of the majority on college campuses for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some time now. Lately, in the cases of the president of Harvard\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#University and that Churchill idiot out in Denver, their work has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#overlapped the same sort of tyranny outside of campus life, due to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the focus of the media on both cases. Both cases want to silence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unpopular opinions, and while no one in their right mind would agree\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with Churchill, I think that FIRE is right in arguing that you cannot\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have a Summers (president of Harvard) without also protecting the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#right of a Churchill to speak. I have somewhat wandered astray here.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The overriding point is that this is an excellent example of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will of the majority going wrong. It was with knowledge that the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#majority in many ways comes to resemble a mob, and that no one in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their right mind wants mob rule, that our founding fathers put\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#checks not just on each branch of government against the other,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but also checks designed to limit the popular impact on governance.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It was to check the mob that we have a president rather than a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#prime minister. We need to remember that, especially in these days\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where the senate has been undermined and is no longer accountable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to the state, but to the people of that state.
