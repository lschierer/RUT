#+TITLE: clarifying the gaim-vv record

Today I wake up to find that Mr. Peter (Bleeter) Lawler's dissatisfaction with Mr. Sean Egan's decisions as they relate to bringing Gaim some voice/video(-vv) functionality has been taken public. I should not be surprised, but I rather was. The first I knew of it was [this OSNews blurb^[1]^](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=12615 "Gaim Kills Off Gaim-VV Webcam Support?"). That in and of itself is likely, even had I not made the mistake of posting to the list about it, enough to ensure this reaches [slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) and causes a rampage of ignorant users.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The OSNews article links to Mr. Lawler's blog, where his side of the argument is.^[[2]](http://www.livejournal.com/users/bleeter/12357.html\ "Death\ of\ gaim-vv")^ He claims it is not an argument,^[[3]](http://www.livejournal.com/users/bleeter/12981.html\ "gaim-vv\ death\ part\ trois")^ but his consistent tone throughout has been confrontational.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In one respect he was wrong, I did mean that he ought not to be insulting me in exactly the way he took it at the time. I was annoyed and upset, and I do not take well to his slander of me. But then, I also doubt he would have taken that tone had we been face to face. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But that aside, let the record, as I have seen it these last two days, stand for itself.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[My conversation with Mr. Lawler](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/gaimstuff/bleeteryaluser-2005-11-10.104519.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[My subsequant conversation with Mr. Egan](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/gaimstuff/seanegn-2005-11-10.154044.html). This second conversation happened several hours later, and I had calmed down considerably from the fustration I felt and unfortunately expressed with Mr. Lawler.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[My conversation with Mr. Richard (rlaager) Laager](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/gaimstuff/rlaager-2005-11-11.093708.html). Mr. Laager is another gaim developer, who IMed me with concerns about the whole mess.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
