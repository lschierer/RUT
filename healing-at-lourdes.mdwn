#+TITLE: Healing at Lourdes

Catholic News Agency is reporting that the Church has recognized a 67th miraculous healing at Lourdes.^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5404\ "Italian\ woman’s\ healing\ at\ Lourdes\ officially\ recognized")^ I wonder what response science would have, if it looked at, this.
