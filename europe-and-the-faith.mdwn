#+TITLE: Europe and the Faith

Father Vincent Twomey has written a fascinating look at what Europe is, and how it came to be in its current state.^[[1]](http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=78846\ "Rediscovering\ the\ Soul\ of\ Europe")^ He also briefly mentions the possibility of renewal on the part of Europe in reaction to the influx of Muslims. I'm not so hopeful as he is, but his article is still well worth reading.
