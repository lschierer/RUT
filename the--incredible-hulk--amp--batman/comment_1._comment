<p>The new Batman was incredibly disturbing! It was a 15 in the UK, which I thought was crazy, because I'm almost 30 and left the cinema totally freaked out. The good thing about Batman films is that the style is always different - the most recent was chilling, the one with Jim Carey was funny, the one with Arnold Schwazernager was camp, and then Batman Returns (long, long ago) was erie and gothic (my personal favourite!)</p>

<p>I agree with the author, the most recent film was a bit too much - although still worth watching. But perhaps an edited version. The knife-face scene was a bit too much!</p>
