#+TITLE: An attempt to get divorce cases out of court

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
[Catholic News Agency](www.catholicnewsagency.com "Catholic News Agency") is reporting that Ave Maria School of Law professor Mr. (Dr.?) Stephen Safranek has filed an appeal on the divorce and custody decision against Mrs. Macfarlane.^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5792\ "Legal\ appeal\ challenges\ civil\ no-fault\ divorce\ unconstitutional")^ Though I do not seem to have written about this case before, I am aware of it. Mrs. Macfarlane lost custody of her children when her husband filed for a no fault divorce, because the judge ruled that her refusal to accept the normalcy and faultlessness of the divorce is grounds to question her parenting. I am pretty sure he went further, that he questioned her sanity, but I cannot find documentation of that now.

Either way, I hope her appeal works, it would create precedent to remove proceedings from a court system that is highly biased in favor of divorce.
