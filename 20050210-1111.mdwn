Nothing particularly caught my eye in this morning's news, but the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#following are worth taking note of, if not sufficient to cause a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#post of their own.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Bad\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#news really can break hearts](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4249859.stm)" describes that stressful\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#events can cause symptoms similar to a heart attack.  
 "[House\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Immigrants Bill Gets White House OK](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-9-2005/20050209160015_12.html)" brings some changes to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the way immigrants are handled. They can't use state driver's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#licenses for some things like boarding planes or entering\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#federal buildings, and they can be deported more easily.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I'm not sure what I make of it; the ID changes are most\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#likely good, the deportation changes I'm less sure of.  
 "[GUESS WHO'S\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#PAYING FOR IT...](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001477.htm)" is rather disturbing I think. While I tend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to sympathize with the judge, I can see this sort of precedent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#being far too easily abused.
