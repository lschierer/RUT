David Limbaugh's "[More\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Thoughts on Schiavo](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/more_thoughts_o.html#more)" helps to bring into focus what part of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the legal battles we have seen is objectionable and what parts are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less so. He rightly reminds us that not all poor decisions are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#judicial activism.

Donald R. May's "[Terri's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Case -- It's All About Money, Power, and Our Constitution](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GuestColumns/May20050321.shtml)"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is also very worth reading. He reminds me of "[Brain-Damaged\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Woman Talks After 20 Years](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050213/D887B94G0.html)," the case of a brain\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#damaged woman who suddenly regained the ability to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#speak after *20 years*. He also points out [Study Reveals Disabled\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Patients Like Terri Schiavo Show Awareness](http://www.lifenews.com/nat1182.html)." I *think*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that I have seen something along these lines somewhere else, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am unsure. Regardless, it is a remarkable example of the limits\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of simply having some strange doctor talk to a patient and expecting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the patients eyes to be able to track the doctor. There is much more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to awareness than just your ability to react in visible ways.

Mr. Limbaugh has, in his post above, come to the point where he\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is starting to understand how a relative of Mrs. Schiavo might be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tempted to resort to illegal measures to save her life at this point.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#My mom reached that point rather more quickly, her personality is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like that. I myself cannot say she is wrong, I do not believe it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can be right to accept a wrong such as this.
