 David Limbaugh [reports](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/01/no_silly_ideas.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on one example of the consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#While I laud Bush and Congress for acting to fix the oh so obvious\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#failure of the public school system to educate, their action was\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in this case misguided. Subsidiarity teaches us that governance\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#moved away from the people is not right, that our society should be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#governed at the lowest level capable of handling a given problem.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#No Child Left Behind flies in the face of this principle, and here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we see the results: it is predictably being used to further stifle\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#excellence, but, now, parents challenging this trend must go to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#federal court, not to a local school board that they can more\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#easily control.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The BBC [reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4203021.stm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on the planned meeting of scientists who don't buy the prevalent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hype on global warming. Professor Fred Singer, a former director\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the US Weather Satellite Service, is quoted saying that "The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#greenhouse warming from increased gas emissions is, as far as we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#can tell, insignificant. It's unlikely to be appreciable even a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#century from now, and we can easily adapt to it." Not what you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#hear in the news every week, now is that? hhmmm.   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Also in the BBC, [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4210369.stm) talks about a recent study on the Shroud of Turin that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#calls into question the 1988 radiocarbon dating find. Perhaps\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#science will once again allow us to believe that the Shroud is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#legitimate. I wouldn't hold your breath though.   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In their unending quest to blur the distinction\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#between Man and animal, scientists are experimenting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with chimeras, as reported by National Geographic [here](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Naturally there is some legit research to be done in this area.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Some things we already do to save lives, like replacing heart valves\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with those from cows or pigs. But this article rightly questions\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how far is too far.   
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Findlaw [reports](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/1-26-2005/20050126084508_10.html)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on a pair of school kids now up on felony\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#charges. For what you ask? They drew threatening\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#stick figures. Yes. Stick Figures. Local6.com [provides\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#additional detail](http://www.local6.com/news/4130302/detail.html), though I do not know how long it will be up.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Apparently these stick figures were sufficient to cause "extreme\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fear" in another 10 year old. Certainly this could have been\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#handled in some other fashion...

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In other, went to Pub Quiz at the 4Ps last night, and surprise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#surprise, Jenn came. :-) We had a very good time. I haven't gotten\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to see Jenn in forever, so it was awesome. PVI wrestled Gonzaga\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#yesterday, Michael lost his varsity match, won his exhibition match.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I think he could have defeated the varsity kid, but he gets so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#discouraged when the other guy has a strong ability to break you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#down. I know how that is, it is very hard to continually work up,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so I do not, cannot, fault him for having lost; he tried hard the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#whole match.
