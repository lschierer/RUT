David Limbaugh wrote a (for him, and, I suppose, for me\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#also) long post on the Schiavo that has been so much in the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#news of late, and so much of the focus of my own writing.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He expressed some of the concerns that I have felt,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but, perhaps, not adequately expressed. Many things that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#resonate strongly with me. I highly suggest you read it at "[Schiavo\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Writ Large](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/schiavo_writ_la.html)." I really can't express things better than he has.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He hits the nail on the head with the disquieting way that evidence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in favor of her recover-ability, of her consciousness, is being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#ignored. He hits the nail on the head at the way that the abortion\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#movement is pro-death, not pro-choice. He hits the nail on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#head that saving the life of this woman is more important to many of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#us who pray for her than the possible damage to our governance the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#efforts to save her may cause. We the living can take care of any\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#damage done later. We can worry about it after we ensure that we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will be alive to do it, that our children will be alive to do it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That the next generation will not be aborted, that we will not be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#killed by a government or "health care" industry that no longer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#values life.
