[This][]^[\\[1\\]][ref1]^ article has some more details of the reaction to my [my previous post][] by the scientific community, or rather, their reaction to the article I posted about. It also differs on when the research was published, claiming last week instead of late last year. Still, it appears that the research is being received relatively favorably. Hopefully the particle accelerator experiment will bear out the results Dr. Svensmark found. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
