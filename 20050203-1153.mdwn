With some help from Vincas in designing a regular expression,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I dressed up this log some today. Dates are now pretty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#printed, and times have a colon in them. I lift them in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#24 hour format, I like that better, all my clocks except\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the alarm clock that cannot, are set to 24 hour time.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I'm happy with the result, but I'm not so happy with the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#code generating it. Being unable to figure out the output for [preg\_split()](http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-split.php),\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I was forced to use 5 lines of code instead of 3.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#This is especially disheartening since a series of [substr()](http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#calls would have only taken 4 lines of code.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Got to see Ederlyn and Joe at Pub Quiz last night. That was nice.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#None of our teams (we had 3) won, I managed to get two wrong myself,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but that still would not have put my team in the tie breaker.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Apparently Philadelphia had the first stock market in the United\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#States, and I forget what other one I was responsible for having\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#missed. In other news, we are holding a degree this Saturday, I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#meant to see if Nicholas was working Saturday or Sunday last night,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but forgot. Going will mean we miss some of WCACs for Michael,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I most likely ought to go to the degree even if Nicholas cannot.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Thus if Nicholas can, I figure 'tis best to do so now than wait yet\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#another month or three. Sunday is Chris and John's Super bowl party,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I almost did not accept that invitation, just as I almost did not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#go to Pub Quiz last night. Don't know why on either one.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mom is having trouble sending and receiving from Mrs. Moffatt.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Finally got around to looking at my mail logs today, and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interestingly enough, cox is *not showing up in them at all*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#One or two incoming messages, and no outgoing ones. I think my\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#next stop will be Mom's address book.
