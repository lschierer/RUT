Michelle Malkin mentioned an article by John\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Tierney entitled "Recycling Is Garbage," but did not\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(accurately) link to it. A quick search on google found it [here](http://www.williams.edu/HistSci/curriculum/101/garbage.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am not able to tell how accurate it is, but it is wonderfully\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#politically incorrect, and very much in accordance with common sense.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I am thus finding myself influenced by it to more strongly support\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a position I previously held on other reports. I have heard at some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#point that in Fairfax County at least, our recycling efforts produce\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more material to be recycled than the recycling centers can handle,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and so the excess is diverted to landfills anyway. Given that,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what is the point of the extra effort and hassle of recycling?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#But this piece goes beyond that, talking about the web of government\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and media action that has led to our current recycling mania.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#It isn't cost efficient, it isn't necessary, and it isn't helping.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Any number of interesting quotes here.

> Plastic packaging and fast-food containers may seem\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#wasteful, but they actually save resources and reduce trash. The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#typical household in Mexico City buys fewer packaged goods than\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an American household, but it produces one third more garbage,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#chiefly because Mexicans buy fresh foods in bulk and throw away\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#large portions that are unused, spoiled or stale. Those apples\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in Dittersdorf's slide, protected by plastic wrap and foam, are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#less likely to spoil. The lightweight plastic packaging requires\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#much less energy to manufacture and transport than traditional\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#alternatives like cardboard or paper. Food companies have switched\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to plastic packaging because they make money by using resources\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#efficiently. A typical McDonald's discards less than two ounces of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#garbage for each customer served-less than what's generated by a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#typical meal at home.

> Plastic packaging is routinely criticized because it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#doesn't decay in landfills, but neither does most other packaging,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as William Rathje, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has discovered from his excavations of landfills. Rathje found that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#paper, cardboard and other organic materials-while technically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#biodegradable-tend to remain intact in the airless confines of a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#landfill. These mummified materials actually use much more landfill\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#space than plastic packaging, which has steadily been getting smaller\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as manufacturers develop stronger, thinner materials. Juice cartons\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#take up half the landfill space occupied by the glass bottles they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#replaced; 12 plastic grocery bags fit in the space occupied by one\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#paper bag.

> "I don't understand why anyone thinks New York City\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#has a garbage crisis because it can't handle all its own waste,"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#says James DeLong, an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Institute in Washington. "With that kind of logic, you'd have to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conclude that New York City has a food crisis because it can't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#grow all the vegetables its people need within the city limits,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so it should turn Central Park into a farm and ration New Yorkers'\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#consumption of vegetables to what they can grow there."

And much much more, providing numbers and numerous examples\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the flaws of the recycling mentality, the only thing lacking\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is the thing that defines the difference between an opinion piece\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for a news paper and a research article, he doesn't really provide\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the references or citations for his numbers and examples, you are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#left to trust to his unknown level of integrity. This article is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a very interesting read that I highly recommend.
