I wonder if a recent move to have the European Union will push proposals to punish and perhaps expel member nations that do not approve of homosexual "marriages."^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5781\ "European\ parliament\ to\ punish\ countries\ that\ do\ not\ approve\ homosexual\ 'marriage'")^ If they do, I wonder if they will fragment over it. How many countries will have the guts to stand up to it?
