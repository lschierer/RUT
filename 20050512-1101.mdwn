In New York, a woman was advised, and attempted, a "chemical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#abortion."[1] They apparently injected something that should\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have killed the baby. Instead, it left the baby alive, but with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#severe physical and mental deformities. The mother tried to sue\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on her own behalf, claiming emotional injury. I understand why an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"emotional injury" tort (is that the right word, I think it is)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exists, because sometimes people do things that they should be held\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accountable for even when no physical injury exists, or beyond\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what the physical injury costs. But I think that its existence\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#only feeds the tendency to sue far too much.

Returning to more important matters here, clearly the doctors are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not liable for the deformities of the baby. They may be liable that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the abortion failed (ironically enough), and they *should*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be *criminally* liable for recommending one (though they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are not). But clearly the deformities are the woman's own fault\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for choosing to attempt to kill her child.

This also clearly shows the power of life. This baby survived\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#despite the attempted abortion, and despite the mother's fibroid\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#tumors, which her doctors thought would cause her to loose the baby.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Once they would have told her what could be done to improve her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#chances. Once they would have fought by her side to help save the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#baby's life. Now they recommend an abortion. Sad.
