They are trying to get included under Canon 844 section 3, namely:

§3. Catholic ministers administer the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick licitly to members of Eastern Churches which do not have full communion with the Catholic Church if they seek such on their own accord and are properly disposed. This is also valid for members of other Churches which in the judgment of the Apostolic See are in the same condition in regard to the sacraments as these Eastern Churches.

As per the article:

They voted in favor of starting a formal discussion with Rome and eventually creating what is called a “single Eucharist community.” This would allow members of the Traditional Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church to take communion at each other’s churches.


This fits under canon 844 Section 3, and at the same time “from a basic theological and operational standpoint, nothing will be different within the church.”  As Canon 844 section 3 is an affirmation that the two churches are in agreement over these sacraments.  IANACL,  however.
