As an introductory side-node, it is interesting that I found this article not via any of the intelligent-design sites I read, but via [slashdot](http://www.slashdot.net).

Anyway, the article says that a group of scientists have found that we need to "[rethink] how geologists interpret varations in the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio throughout Earth's History."[^20080911-1]  Or in other words, we really do not know how old anything that has been carbon-dated is.
