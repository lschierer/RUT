Two bits of science news today. "[Classic\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#maths puzzle cracked at last](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7180)" talks about patterns in numbers.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Mathematicians were apparently surprised as they discovered how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#prevalent these are, but I am not. It is the same sort of argument\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that is being made when you look at the finite ranges in which life\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as we know it could exist.

The other is "

"\>Startling\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Scientists, Plant Fixes Its Flawed Gene," which suggests there\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#may be more to heredity than Mendel's laws and DNA. If so, this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would raise the explanatory bar for evolution *significantly*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#higher, as a mutation must get past this extra set of non-DNA\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#based accuracy checks. Why have we not noticed this before?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Perhaps because it was not looked for?
