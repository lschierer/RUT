#+TITLE: We have a server!

We finally have a server to host the project!! Donated and hosted by dvlabs.com, this is a huge step forward for us as a project. I am slowly configuring it, getting apache2, subversion, planet, mysql, and such up and running. It is a slow process, but fortunately we are not pressed for time yet.
