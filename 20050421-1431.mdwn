Their security practices are impacting the ability of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Christians, primarily Catholics and Orthodox, to live and prosper\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as well. It is important to remember that just as the Muslim\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#population wants an end to Israel, so too does Israel really want\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an end to anyone non-Jewish living in Israel.
