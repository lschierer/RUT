#+TITLE: Extending CALEA

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
The [Electronic Frontier Foundation(EFF)](www.eff.org "Electronic Frontier Foundation"), the [Electronic Privacy Information Center(EPIC)](www.epic.org "Electronic Privacy Information Center"), the [American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU)](www.aclu.org "American Civil Liberties Union") and others are fighting an attempt to extend the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).^[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/27/AR2006012701086.html\ "Could\ Your\ VoIP\ Phone\ Be\ Tapped?")^ I believe this fight, though worthy, is doomed to failure. Someone will raise the terrorism issue, how terrorists could use VoIP to avoid detection, and it will be downhill from there.

Which raises the question (Mr.?) Uwe Hermann asks.^[[2]](http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/how-to-detect-and-defeat-hardware-backdoors-and-wiretaps\ "How\ to\ detect\ and\ defeat\ hardware\ backdoors\ and\ wiretaps?")^ Given that CALEA will be extended, and that hackers will take advantage of whatever backdoors are introduced, how do we handle this? How can we detect what backdoors are available and defend against them?
