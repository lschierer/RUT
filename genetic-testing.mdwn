#+TITLE: genetic testing

In [Gatica News](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/index.php?s=gatica), the Seattle Times has a guest column which mentions that a railroad company has looked to genetic testing in a (fortunately failed) bid to avoid liability for worker's injuries.[[1]](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002423250_sundaygenome07.html) Apparently they hoped an "unproven test" would demonstrate a predisposition that would allow them to avoid workman's compensation claims. This sort of testing is exactly like the situation "Gatica" portrays, and ought to be a cause of concern.
