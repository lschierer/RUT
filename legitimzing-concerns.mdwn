Denver's Archbishop Charles Chaput has apparently noticed and is concerned about the same sort of anti-Catholicism that I have been commenting on.[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4587) He specifically mentions Europe and Canada, and the potential for the United States to follow down that path.
