"[Raising\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pit bull children](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/dg20050212.shtml)" is amusing. It is an extended analogy with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a great deal of truth to it, but I can't help but find the repeated\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#references to put bulls funny. Seriously though, he has a point,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where are children supposed to learn to stand up for their beliefs if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not from their parents? We need to assert that there is such a thing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as absolute truth. We need to hold our selves accountable to it.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We need to hold our society accountable as well, and work to change\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what doesn't stand up. This last is something I fail at I fear.
