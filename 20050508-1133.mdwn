A pair of students now have been found guilty of trespassing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because they were building a snow fort on grounds of the high school\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#they attend, on a snow day.[1] The article makes it sound like the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#police officer was throwing his weight around, being a bully,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and is getting away with it. I doubt anyone now, except the two\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#kids and the police officer could really say for sure, both sound\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#possible to me. I can see an officer getting upset at the lack\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of respect from some of today's brats. I can also see an officer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#getting upset at having his authority legitimately challenged,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and deciding to throw the book at the kids. Personally though,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these simply cannot be the brightest kids in the world, they could\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so easily just have left and come back later.
