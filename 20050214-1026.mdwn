Some lawyer was convicted of passing messages\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#from imprisoned terrorists to unimpassioned ones.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#She claims that the attorney-client privilege\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#protects her from prosecution for her actions in "[Rights\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Lawyer Vows to Appeal Conviction](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211004504_02.html)."

The woman\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#apparently made up a story of someone throwing a baby out a car\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#window so as to hide the fact that she had been pregnant from her\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#family.
