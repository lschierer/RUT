So apparently,[1] "household" means a married family still in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Florida. Normally that would please me, but this is just bizarre.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#How is that a marriage license is required to limit payments from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an insurance company, when we are seeking to have benefits extend\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to those that are merely living together in a so called "committed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#relationship?" I worry that this will be used by homosexual\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"rights" activists to further the push for homosexual "marriages."\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That being said, the other two judges are exactly right: if you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are not related by blood, adoption, or marriage, you cannot really\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be part of the same household. I am all for extended families,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but including a live-in boyfriend as part of the family is further\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#than I would be willing to go.
