#+TITLE: The uncheckable power of a court decision

The ability to amend the constitution is one of the checks on the judiciary set in the system of government set up by the founding fathers. As they envisioned it, did the court come to an unacceptable decision, the constitution could be amended to force their hand. If homosexual activists in Massachusetts are correct, this vital check does not exist there.^[[1]](http://washingtontimes.com/national/20060103-103432-3042r.htm\ "Massachusetts\ sued\ on\ marriage\ petition")^ They assert that under Article 48 of that state's constitution, "citizens cannot use constitutional amendments to reverse judicial decisions."^[[1]](http://washingtontimes.com/national/20060103-103432-3042r.htm\ "Massachusetts\ sued\ on\ marriage\ petition")^ This seems incredibly stupid.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
