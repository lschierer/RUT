Oliver North quoted an Iraqi governor who in just a couple sentences\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#captured the transforming power that women hold: "Women voting\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#will change everything. No woman who carries a child for nine\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#months wants that child to grow up to be a suicide terrorist. They\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#want the politicians to give their children something to live for,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not die for -- and we will have to do it."^[1](#iraq1)^ Women, who safe-guard life in its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#earliest moments, have the power to shape society like no other.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Beyond moments such as this quote refers to, I am reminded of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homily I heard at St. Veronica's last week. Guys are very simple;\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#we want to be in relationship with a girl. And, for the right\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#girl, we'll do anything in our power, and some things we would have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thought impossible, to keep her in our lives. This gives girls an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unique chance to influence the world. They get to set a standard\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for the men in their lives, for the men they choose to date, the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#man they choose to marry, the children they raise. Men are of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#course not absolved of responsibility, it is a poor man indeed who\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#does not exceed common expectations for morality, decency, honor in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#today's society, but it is women who define what is "exceptional"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and what is "expected." God help our girls to set high standards\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#once again.
