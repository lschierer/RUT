#+TITLE: unscientific linguistic quiz

Even though this quiz has been deemed entirely unscientific,^[[1]](http://damian792.livejournal.com/23649.html\ "Whatchutalkinbout\ Willis?")^ it still managed to peg the fact that much of my family, and thus presumably my speech, comes from the north. I am not sure where it got the 5%Upper Midwestern from. I myself noted flaws in 3 questions, notably \#10 where there was no correct answer for me, I had never heard of *any* of the three phrases. On a side note, I was visiting an aunt of mine on the eastern shore this weekend. She and my uncle retired there, but grew up and worked in the DC area. Her "Warshington" is *much* more pronounced than mine is.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
