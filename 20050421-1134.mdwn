Phyllis Schlafly is on questionable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#grounds for a "conservative" in her [recent\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/ps20050418.shtml). She comes out strongly in favor of the REAL ID Act\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(H.R. 418). She states:

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> All but 10 states already require driver's license\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#applicants to prove legal presence in the United States. All but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#14 states require verification of at least one of the documents\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#applicants produce, and 22 states and the District of Columbia\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#require licenses to expire with temporary visas.

> The states that don't currently have these standards are a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#magnet not only for illegal immigrants, but also for foreign\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#terrorists and U.S. criminals and identity thieves. Congress has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a duty to close these monumental gaps in our national security,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and the Senate should promptly pass the REAL ID ACT.

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Where in the constitution does Congress have this duty imposed?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Under what article and section does it have the authority to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mandate standards for identification? When did we delegate to the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Federal government such regulation of our own citizens? Make no\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mistake about it, for all she rests her argument on the fact that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#illegal immigrants can now obtain a driver's license, this would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be regulating the lives of you and I. This moves us closer to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a "National ID," something I have fairly consistently opposed.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#What difference would there be between that and an internal passport\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#except that you wouldn't need the visa stamp pages? In that light,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the clear course is to maintain control over identification at the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#state level, we should be working to *remove* the federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#government from such matters, not *increase* its role.
