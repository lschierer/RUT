Ars is talking about a flash hard drive from Samsung.[1] At 16Gb\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#max, it is, by today's standards, too small for most desktop use.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#We are all spoiled by the massive 40Gb, 80Gb, and bigger hard drives\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#available now, and most people would have trouble getting accustomed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to having "only" 16Gb of space now. After all, my old desktop from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#college even had something like 13Gb. Still, with 16Gb available\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#now (or rather, in August or so), it is only a matter of time\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#before these drives start reaching the sizes we are accustomed to.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In many modern systems, the disk i/o is a significant choke point, so\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a 150 percent performance increase here will certainly be noticeable,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and few people (who don't download lots of movies) will notice if\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the high end of these drives starts to compete (size wise) with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the low end current drive, so long as the price wise is competitive\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with other drives (not necessarily of the same size).
