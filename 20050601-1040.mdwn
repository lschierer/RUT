Way back when I was in grade school, there was a significant\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#amount of opposition to having sex ed in St. Josephs. Reading some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of the recent townhall.com articles, I begin to see the danger here\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that simply was not even envisioned back then. While I doubt that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#even at their worst, any of the Catholic Schools have anything even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#approaching the horrors that Ms. Janice Shaw Crouse documents,[1] I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#*do* see the rise in outcome-based-education type initiatives\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the Catholic School system here to have a significant potential\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for state or federal regulation of the Catholic school systems\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#much along the lines of the "Standards of Learning" tests now\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#mandated for the public schools. Such regulation would eventually\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#contain mandates for programs such as those that Ms. Crouse rightly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#denounces.
