I found "[Groupware\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Bad](http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html)" by Jamie Zawinski today off of Joel on Software. Its an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#impressive write-up in a couple respects. First of all, it addresses\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#why groupware is so horrid. His language is crude, but his overall\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#point is correct, groupware is overly managed. No one actually wants\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this except managers. To the extend you are a user, this sort of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#thing will be a pain in the neck. How many people really think "Oh,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I just finished a task, let me go check that off on my todo list in\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this other application over here." Most of us are better at writing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#lists than scratching things off them, even when we do accomplish\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#things we have listed. Secondly, he is right about the developer\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#interest. Groupware is about... groups, surprisingly enough.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#And how does your average developer work in groups? Well, he works\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#semi-independently and rather anarchically with some people many of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#whom he has never met and certainly is not on the same network with.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#He associates with his friends every day, but he is not on the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#same network with them either. And he really doesn't think about\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#his or plan his free time in the same way that you would schedule a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#meeting in the office. Rather, its more like "hey, you all want to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#get together this weekend?" "Sure, when and where should we meet?"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Oh, about 7:30 my place" and then people show up from 7:15 to 8:00,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#with lots of cell phone calling involved to see who is actually\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#coming and so forth. The infrequent party is planned somewhat\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#more, and things like Evite come in and work okay but not great.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#So the end result is that the calendaring application He describes is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#actually rather cool. I'm not sure how it would work, it would need\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#some web space certainly, and to work it would have to be developed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#along the install of [blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which can be dropped in where ever you have access to web space with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#cgi capabilities. Blosxom is something I discovered yesterday by\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#accident, it needs a post of its own. Anyway, back to calendaring,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it would need a combination of email and web space, with some sort\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of user authentication since you do not want to go the "you must be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#using this mail client" route. Though you might be able to set it\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#up such that "if you are using this mail client you don't have to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#click that link over there and go fill out some form on a web page"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#which would make it more business friendly. But that's fluff (from\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#my point of interest). So I'm not quite sure how it would work.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Most blog things allowing comments seem to go the sql route.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#That would certainly work, but would create a higher entry bar,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you would need a web space with sql capabilities. So I am not sure\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how possible this is, but it would be cool. :-)
