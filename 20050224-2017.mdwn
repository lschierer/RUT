We are releasing gaim 1.1.4 today, just a week after 1.1.3; we\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#found a couple crashers (one a security risk) and are now working\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#around a bug in glib 2.6.2 (on some platforms). It always gives me\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a thrill to release even for something like this, that I'd rather\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have caught for 1.1.3.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In other news, its been snowing all day, but not really sticking to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the roads until recently, it has been too warm of late. It made\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for a slow and boring day at work, consistently wishing it would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#snow enough to justify going home. Thankfully I'd gotten in early\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and skipped lunch, so I was able to leave at 4:30, I can't imagine\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#having stayed till 6 as I usually do. I found out last night that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Andrius is engaged, yay! :-) I had an a fairly good talk with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Vincas at Pub Quiz (one of our teams won!), nice and geeky, on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Unicode and the text replacement plugin. Oddly, hyphenated isn't\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#able to reproduce the wide character bug that has been reported,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and I am unable to find the report. Ah-well, such is life.
