Ederlyn's del.icio.us listing pointed me at an amusing story\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of science's early, more innocent, more honest, days: "[Museums of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Hoaxes](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoaxmuseums.html)." Of particular interest is the ability of these men to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#conduct scientific inquiry that forms the foundation of much we know\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#today while still preserving their ability to wonder at the marvels\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in creation. As written here, many of these are pantheistic, but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you can easily see God having the same sort of fun, our sense of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#humor comes from somewhere after all.
