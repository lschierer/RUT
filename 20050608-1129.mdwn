School vouchers seem like a good idea at first. Why not get our\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#kids out of badly performing public schools? Why not use the money\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on schools that can actually teach them? It provides accountability\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(in the form of lower budgets) to the schools, and it helps the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#children to get the education they so desperately need. I dislike,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#fear, the idea though. The Florida Supreme Court is now looking at\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a Florida bill that represents the first statewide school voucher\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#program.[1] Opponents charge that this bill causes public money\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be spent on religious education. And in many senses, they are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#absolutely right. Because even if you cause the school to track\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#where each dollar goes, spending this money on science and math\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#frees up other funds for religion, and so the argument can be made\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that it is in essence funding religion. This may or may not win,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it really does not matter.

What concerns me is that the use of public funds, in any way\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#or form, opens the door to regulation. Just as many charities\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#are now regulated, needing to conform to costly health laws that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a restaurants would need to for example, so too our schools will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#be increasingly exposed to education laws. And this is not good,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#because it will expose them to the type of science standards\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that have put evolution debates in the court systems time and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#time again. It will expose them to history standards that can be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#used to push a secular interpretation of history. It will expose\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them to requirements for sex ed, and a host of other regulations.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Because as long as you take government dollars, you are subject to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#their rules on how you spend them.
