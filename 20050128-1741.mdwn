So I realized today why I'm having trouble with single and double\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#quotes for my mom's poems. WordPerfect, like MSWord, isn't using\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#real quotes. It is using "Fancy" or "Curly" quotes. Now I just\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#need to learn how to turn that off. :-)  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Once I have that working, I should be able to trust my code to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#create web pages correctly. I'll be moving her over to a slightly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#different submit form that works better for just about everything\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#else she'll hit. And once I can trust the code to write web pages\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#directly, I can generate more than just the web page, I can generate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#other views than simply alphabetical. On a side note, if I can\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#learn about creation time and such from php, then I can do this now,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and not have to generate a static page for each other view.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#**Update 17:55:** And it turns out I can learn this,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and so [this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#page](http://www.schierer.org/~ann/date.php) now exists, after a custom compare function to use\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#function](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filemtime.php). :-D
