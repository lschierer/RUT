Japan, with its huge press of people, has a very high level\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of complaints from women about the liberties some men have taken\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in the train cars.[1] Predictably, some men are complaining,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I really do not see another viable solution, given the press.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#They *could* institute lower maximum occupancies, but they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#would have a very hard time enforcing them, it would basically\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#require someone standing at each door letting people in and out\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#slowly enough that they could be counted. In other words, it would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#slow down service incredibly, raise prices (wages cost), and lower\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the total capacity. So as I was saying, I really do not see a way\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#around this. Of course, this totally flies in the face of men and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#women being identical. â˜º
