#+TITLE: "human >= pigeon"

Ederlyn managed to aptly demonstrate what is insane about PETA today. She stated that a human is more valuable than a pigeon.[[1]](http://www.livejournal.com/users/baranoouji/216584.html) I will never forget hearing a PETA representative state on a radio program that given a choice between hitting a baby and a rat, she would choose to hit the baby.
