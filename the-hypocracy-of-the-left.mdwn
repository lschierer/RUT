\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
Sometimes I wonder if people *practice* being logically inconsistent. Mr. Richard Stallman is my latest example of stupidity. He claims he supported the war on Afghanistan "because the Taliban were horrible,"^[[1]](http://www.stallman.org/archives/2005-nov-feb.html#04%20February%202006%20(Afghanistan%205%20years%20after)\ "Afghanistan\ 5\ years\ after")^ but does *not* support the war in Iraq, where the Kurds were being killed and gassed by their own ruler. The hypocrisy is mind boggling.
