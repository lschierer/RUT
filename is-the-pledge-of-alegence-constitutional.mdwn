#+TITLE: Is the Pledge of Alegence Constitutional?

The Pledge of Allegiance is back in court, and apparently doing fairly well.[[1]](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1123684515276&rss=newswire) As the 4Th Circuit has upheld its constitutionality, it appears that this issue might reach the Supreme Court again more quickly than I had suspected, as the new case in California is not this far along. The article, however, makes no mention of the ruling that I would *like* to see: that there is no wall of separation between church and state, but only a requirement of non-establishment.
