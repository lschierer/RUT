The NYTimes is all excited about the findings of a group of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Swedish researchers. In a number of different sections of of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#times, based on my RSS feeds, they posted an article in which\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#homosexual men responded to a pair of chemicals thought to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pheromones the way normal women do, not the way normal men do.[1]\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The researchers claim that the data on homosexual women is "too\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#complicated" to publish, which leads me to question this study, how\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and why could it possibly be "too complicated?" Further, they admit\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that they cannot, from this study, tell the difference between cause\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and effect. Which means that they do not know if homosexuality\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is causing the changed reaction, or if the changed reaction is\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#causing homosexuality. Either way, this does not detract from the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#idea that homosexuality is, at root, a disease, it just means that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it may be a physical disease and not just a mental one.
