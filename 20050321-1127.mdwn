A quick rundown of some of the news in the Terri\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Schiavo case. (Which is the correct spelling? I see\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#people spelling her first name both ways.) David Limbaugh [points\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#out](http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/terry_schiavo_c.html) some resources and information that FindLaw has aggregated [here](http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/lit/schiavo/index.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The CSMonitor, a news source I picked up\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at Nan's advice, has an article on the case [here](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0321/p01s03-uspo.html).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Predictably, they are not too pleased with the Congress and\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the president right now. They do ask an interesting question,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#how would I feel about this if Congress were interfering with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the State government on the other side of this mess? I would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#probably be pretty upset. So perhaps the federal intervention\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is not the best thing for us to have happening in the long\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#run, but it is nice to see the federal government doing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the right thing for once, even if I am unsure of their ends.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[This](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4367201.stm)\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is one of the fairest articles from the BBC that I have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#seen since I started paying attention. Usually the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#BBC comes down fairly strong in its portrayal of this\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as a "Right to Die" case. Michelle Malkin weights in [here](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001812.htm).\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#She has a quote from a Wall Street Journal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article, I kind of wish I had a Wall Street Journal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#login to access the original. She also links to "[Terri:\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#A Nurse's Perspective](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2005/03/terri-nurses-perspective.html)." I should ask Mollie about that, but I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#most likely will not. It does not stand to reason that starving\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to death would be a "painless" way to die. Going without food\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#for even a few days can be painful, I know that from my one insane\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#weight cut in high school. I am sure that any of the children you\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#see in the advertisements for various charities with their stomachs\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#bloated from hunger would differ as well.
