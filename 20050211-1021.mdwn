"[Arizona\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Revisits the Jury Patriotism Act](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211020002_3.html)" looks at some of the issues\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#surrounding jury duty across the country, focusing on an Arizona\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#law (obviously) that has made it hard for chronically ill seniors\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to demonstrate they cannot serve.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#What's up with "[Army\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Grants Discharge to Black Chaplain](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1152/2-10-2005/20050210021502_15.html)"? It says "More than a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#century later, an Army board has upheld the court-martial but\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#granted Plummer a posthumous honorable discharge," which raises\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#several questions in my mind. One, what are they looking at a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#century old case for? Two, how in the world do you uphold the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#court marshal but change the discharge? Someone who understands\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#these things please explain this seeming illogic to me.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#In furtherance of "security," we have "[House\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#OKs Citizenship Check for Licenses](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-10-2005/20050210121505_14.html)," under which you would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have to be a citizen to get a driver's license. What's the Federal\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#government doing involved with this? Good question.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Along the same lines, "[House\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to Vote on Immigration Bill](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-10-2005/20050210010009_4.html)" states that a "guestworker"\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#program is still not coming up for a vote. I'm not sure what I\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#think of that one. It isn't right the way we have people who need\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#work who can't legally get it, but it also isn't right to reward\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#them for having broken the law to be here. I'm not sure what the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#right answer is, the amnesty or deporting them all.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I've been asked to look for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#crime news, and so the following:  
 "[Texas\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Father Criticized After Baby's Death](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211043015_07.html)" drives home [a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#point I made yesterday](http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/view.php?date=20050210-1655) that some people are monsters.  
 "[Ill.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Man Charged With Second Murder](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211043015_04.html)" is similar, at least he seems\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be stopped now, hopefully they will lock him up for life.
