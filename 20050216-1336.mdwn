Okay, so if you needed any confirmation, I am now officially an\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#idiot. I didn't realize what the orphaned lspdev package was doing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#until after I tried to manually delete many of the files removing\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it left behind. Only to realize that I had actually removed pretty\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#much all of /usr. Fortunately /home was a different partition,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and dpkg --get-selections \> file let me record every installed\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#package in a way that let me quickly and easily reinstall my system\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#(quickly because I have a mirror of debian here on the network ;-).
