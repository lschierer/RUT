#+TITLE: libfuse2 woes

Discovered tonight that libfuse2 forces fuse file systems, such as gluster, to mount with nodev,nosuid. This means that I cannot host an ikiwiki with CGI support on a gluster file system. This does not please me. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#I would really like to see this, and read/write shared mmaps (for spamprobe and similar) to be supported in fuse file systems (and naturally gluster in particular).
