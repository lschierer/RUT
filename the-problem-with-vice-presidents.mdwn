#+TITLE: The problem with Vice Presidents

Is that they effectively have no power. That is why even if former governor Mike Huckabee is chosen as the vice-presidential candidate for one of the pro-death candidates, which the Associated Press thinks likely,[\^200711081] the quandary I expressed yesterday[\^200711082] will remain in full force. I doubt picking Mr. Huckabee as his vice president will represent a true and substantial shift away from the pro-death, anti-family stance that Giliani represents, nor that Mitt Romney is \*really\* pro-life. \#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#[\^200711081]: Associated Press.
