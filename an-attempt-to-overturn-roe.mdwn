#+TITLE: An attempt to overturn Roe

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
South Dakota is considering stepping up to the plate in the fight to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.^[[1]](http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail2817.cfm?Id=0,45410\ "SD\ Legislature\ To\ Consider\ Abortion\ Ban")^ The state legislature has before it a bill to criminalize abortion. Though it has been vetoed once already, it was because of some technicalities, and lawmakers think that this version of it might become law.

Obviously such a bill will quickly be declared unconstitutional, if it does pass. These lawmakers believe that with Chief Justice John Roberts and possibly soon Judge Samuel Alito, on the court, things may have changed enough to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. By my count, we are still one vote short, but I wish them luck none-the-less.
