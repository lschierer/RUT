Quite a bit happening in the news today. A quick run down, I may\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#come back to some of this in more depth later.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[New\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proof that man has caused global warming](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1489955,00.html)" apparently only human\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#caused global warming fits the data according to the models they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#looked at.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Gene\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#map opens up uncharted territory](http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050214/full/050214-17.html)" talks about using the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#genome to target certain diseases. This is so close to being\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#able to target your biological weapons at certain populations\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that the scientist even realized it and tried to say they\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#weren't looking at race. Oh and what's up with all the pink here?\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[DNA\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#map to help target new drugs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4275695.stm)" has more on this.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Wall of Separation Between Church and State](http://www.catholicherald.com/articles/05articles/separation.htm)" fascinating\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#article on why the "Separation of Church and State" is a myth\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that should be overturned. Also, interestingly, it isn't even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#all that old an interpretation. Only 60 years or so. Sounds like\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#its about the same time as the right to privacy mess started to be\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#... um, my word choice here was about to be a little *too*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#coincidental.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Bush\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to Sign Bill Curbing Lawsuits](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1151/2-18-2005/20050218024503_20.html)" affects class action law\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#suits.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Senate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#OKs Ban on Genetic Discrimination](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-18-2005/20050218050016_38.html)" sounds all Gatica\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Landlord\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Tosses Tear Gas Grenade in House](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/features/1120/2-18-2005/20050218051502_60.html)" is weird.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[Judge\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Upholds Ban on Polygamous Marriage](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-17-2005/20050217074505_26.html)" about which I can only say\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"Thank goodness there is still some sanity."  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#"[New\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Robots Walk Like Humans](http://www.livescience.com/technology/050217_robot_walking.html)" Title says it all.  
\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Thank you for reading this addition of Luke's random news. I hope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you have found something of interest. This has been a presentation\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of Luke's random news.
