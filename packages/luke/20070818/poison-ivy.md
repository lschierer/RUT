I somehow managed to get poison ivy across my left check and nose.  I think I picked it up on the meandering walk home from St. Veronica's that Lauren and I took Tuesday night.  If not then, it must be in Mom's garden somewheres.  

It is only very mildly itchy, but it is managing to significantly annoy me anyway.  I put some cortisone cream stuff on at Lauren's a few hours ago, but it only really helped for a few minutes.  Not worth it.
