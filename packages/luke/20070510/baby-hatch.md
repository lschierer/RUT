A Catholic Hospital in Japan has set up a "baby hatch" where parents can drop off unwanted infants anonymously.[^bh1]  The Prime Minister and the Mayor of Kumamoto, the city in which it opened, oppose this, but found no legal grounds on which to stop it.  Both appear to object to it on the grounds that it should not be necessary.

I agree absolutely, it *should* not be necessary.  But in any country where the birthrate is held unnaturally low by abortion, it *is* necessary.  We must give parents every possible alternative to aborting their children.  We must give them every assistance, every reassurance, every help.  If having an ability to drop off a baby at a hospital, where it will have a chance at life, will persuade even a few parents not to kill that poor innocent child, then it is something we must accept, for now, as we work to change society.
