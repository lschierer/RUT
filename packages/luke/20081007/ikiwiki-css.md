In other news, I have spent a little bit of time modifying the css for ikiwiki to attempt to match the css I use elsewhere.  It is a fustrating process.  I ended up changing the theme I use for everything else in an attempt to be more ikiwiki friendly, but while I have ended up with a collection of style.css files that mostly work, I cannot be entirely happy, there is a decided lack of cohesion here.

I suspect I will need to dive into the template files for ikiwiki to make more progress.
