<p>In the sort of case that you might have expected to see in Spain during the height of the Inquisition, an Afghan man is being prosecuted and faces the death penalty for converting to Christianity.<sup><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004796.htm" title="A Christian On Trial">[1]</a></sup> I saw this elsewhere yesterday, but lost the link in a browser crash.  From what I gather, it appears that even under the newer government in Afghanistan, religious freedom is pretty much nonexistent.  Everyone has to obey Islamic religious law, including the part that says that someone who abandons Islam should be killed.  This pretty much negates the ability of any religion to convert anyone, even outside the country (as is apparently the case here), if they might return to, move to, or visit Afghanistan.  Well, not really, they can of course convert, but the convert will be at risk&#x2026;</p>  <font size="-2"><ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Mrs. Michelle Malkin.
