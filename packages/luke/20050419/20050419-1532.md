<p> We have a Pope!!</p>

<p>The College of Cardinals has elected Benedict XVI,
formerly Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as pope.  If you have
been hiding under a rock somewhere and have not heard
this name, Vincas points out that Wikipedia already has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI"</a>quite
a collection of facts</a> about him.  My prayers are with our
new pope.</p>

<p>I suspect that things will not be easy for him, he is going to
face quite a bit of dislike from the people who insist on believing
that any pope could or would change the Church's teaching on
homosexual "marriage," women in the clergy, divorce, or a host of
other issues.  But then, I think that any pope would have to face
that, not just one starting his pontificate with a well established
history of theological orthodoxy.</p>
