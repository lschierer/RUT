<p>If a Catholic Hospital is truly concerned about money collection to the point of neglecting its mission to save lives regardless of the financial state of its patients, then something is clearly wrong. Equally obviously, any such wrong should be addressed and fixed. Something does not add up however.  The bill being pushed in Illinois would push those Catholic hospitals not already running deficits into deficit spending, and would cost them over $158 million a year.<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/blog/?p=160" title="Just a bad toenail or is about money?">[1]</a></sup> When the ads supporting this bill specifically target the Catholic institutions, which provide 25% of the free car in Illinois, you have to wonder about the motivation.  Is this really about some flaw in the hospitals, or more about attacking the Church?</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Mr. Alejandro Bermudez. "Just a bad toenail or is about money?"
