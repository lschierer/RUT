I have finished <i>Mr. Blue</i>,<sup>[1]</sup> recommended by and borrowed from Vincas.  I can see why he likes it.  But I do not think I shall read it again.  Blue is indeed an intriguing fellow, the sort of character that our modern world no doubt needs more of, and is , with even less doubt, ill equipped to understand.  The end of the book casts a shadow over its entirety though, one that <em>I</em> am ill equipped to handle.  It is much like Mr. Ray Bradbury's short stories:  I am glad to have them, but I can handle them only in small and infrequent doses.
