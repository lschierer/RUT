Today being Ash Wednesday means today is a day of fasting and
abstinence, and I am certainly feeling it.  I went to the communion
service at St. Veronica's at lunch today (it was scheduled in the
bulletin as a Mass, but that was apparently an error) and received
my ashes.  A good thing, since its hard to make it to a Mass after
work much of the time, but it means I didn't have time for lunch.
So "One normal meal (except no meat) and 2 small meals that together
do not equal a full meal" has quickly turned into "one normal meal"
for me today.  Ah-well, such is life.
