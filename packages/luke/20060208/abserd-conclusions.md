<p>A <em>first grader</em> was suspended from school for sexual harassment.<sup><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/02/08/D8FL3EGO0.html" title="First Grader Suspended for Harassment">[1]</a></sup> I am very tempted to agree with his mother in saying there is no way a first grader could understand sexual harassment.  Her explanation makes far more sense.  If he did however, it can only be because of the sexualization of life that we expose our children to on television, in the movies, and most importantly in our misguided attempts to protect them from just such abuse.</p>  <p>We need to wake up to the fact that a child is not responsible, cannot be responsible, for protecting his or her self from predators. It is the responsibility of adults to ensure that a child never need do so.</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Associated Press.
