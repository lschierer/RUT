<p> Quite a bit of activity surrounding Terri Schiavo (I have
been misspelling her name apparently).  Congress still has not
managed to pass the right to life bill, apparently still haggling
over the narrow one specific to this case that the Senate passed.
They are looking to exercise eminent domain or some such to move
the case to federal court, that apparently requires justification.
In a rather neat twist, the House as subpoenaed her!  This action,
it seems, forbids her doctors and such from acting in a way that
would cause her death.  They've also ordered as much, it seems,
though that might just be confusion, but its unclear they have the
power to do so.  Still, I read that the Florida judge ordered the
tube removal stayed at least until the House subpoena is cleared
up,if it is &#x263a;.  This is all over the New York Times,
the BBC, some in FindLaw, some on Drudge, David Limbaugh and
Michelle Malkin are also writing about it.  I am not going to try
to provide links to all these stories here, you can find them at
