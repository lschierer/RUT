<p> "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/politics/28commandments.html?position=&ei=5088&en=04622c8714f6c1b2&ex=1267333200&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">The
Ten Commandments Reach the Supreme Court</a>" is yet another
update on the issue of the Ten Commandments in public displays,
specifically publicly funded displays such as court rooms and
grounds.  President Bush is supporting it, and one law professor,
surprisingly writing for a Baptist organization (just goes to
show, you can't trust protestants ;-), is against it because it
"secularizes" a sacred symbol.  How can a single Justice be said
to have cast the deciding vote?  Surely a reversal of <em>any</em>
of them would change it?  Or is it simply that only Justice O'Connor
votes "inconsistently" on this issue?  </p>
