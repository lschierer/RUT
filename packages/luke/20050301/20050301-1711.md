<p> I've talked about the Connecticut case involving
Eminent Domain <a href=".view.php?date=20050222-1237">at
least once before</a>.  Jacob Sullum's recent article, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jacobsullum/js20050225.shtml">Can
the Supreme Court stop the spread of blight?</a>" neatly summarizes
the issues involved and why I'm opposed to this use of Eminent
Domain.  He also reminds the reader of the limitations we no longer
have on this sometimes legitimate government power; limitations that
would ensure that its use is in fact legitimate.  Unfortunately,
from reading this article, it appears that the US Supreme Court has
not or will not find this use of Eminent Domain unconstitutional.</p>
