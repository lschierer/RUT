<p>The New York times is featuring an article on a robot not much
more expensive than the average middling-high end computer.[1] For
a little under $2000, its basically a computer case on wheels, from
the sounds of it, with some fancy optical gear built in.  The company
selling these is White Box Robotics[2].  Ederlyn might be interested
in this sort of thing, she has a fascination with robots.</p>
