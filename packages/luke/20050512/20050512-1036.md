<p>Legal news run down.</p>

<ul> <li>"<a href="http://www.local6.com/news/4479554/detail.html">Iris Scanning
To Begin At Orlando International Airport</a>" not quite legal news,
but not quite not legal news either.  This is not a development I
particularly like to see.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/p/56/05-11-2005/2e12000da28a8a8a.html">Senators
debate merits of Patriot Act while agreeing no abuses have been
documented</a>" Quite a few of these clauses <em>need</em> to go.
The <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a> has details on this bill.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/c530000adf2147d6.html">Judge
Rejects DMV Practice on Licenses</a>" This comes right as the REAL
ID Act passes in Congress and awaits the President's signature.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/c78700127ab801dc.html">Judge
OKs Day Care Center for Blind Couple</a>" Sad to see the government
bullying people like this.  I would tend to think that parents can
decide this one, and beyond that, this couple has apparently been
doing daycare, as employees of someone else, for some time now.
Surely they would be aware of their ability, or lack there of, to
take on the whole job.  Also, how would their blindness "adversely
affect" children?  I could see the agency saying that they would
not be able to do the work, I could see them saying the children
would suffer neglect, but if that is what they meant, why not just
say so?</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-11-2005/e4fd001a4d27fd5c.html">Calif.
Panels Reject Gay Marriage Ban</a>" I am not giving this one a
post of its own since homosexual "marriages" are still banned in
California.  But it is sad to see one more protection for marriage
and the family denied.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115802310733">Marijuana,
Ten Commandments and Retirement Questions Await Supreme Court</a>"
offers a brief look at some of the cases that will be heard in the
United States Supreme Court this year.</li>

</ul>
