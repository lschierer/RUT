<p>Ms. Rebecca Hagelin continues to point out the numbers documenting
our cultural disaster.[1] Its useful to know at times, these are
the sort of things that you bring up when others want to justify
this or that.  But the barrage of numbers, of statistics, has its
own danger, we tend to turn our brains off and tune things out when
the problem seems overwhelming, and the numbers seem never-ending.
Plus, we all distrust statistics now, and with good reason.  What is
the right approach? I do not know.</p>
