Intel has started including Digital Rights Management(DRM)
functionality in their Pentium line of chips.[^1] The new Pentium D
processor will have functionality that will both tie in with the
Windows DRM functionality, and will also allow administrators to
remotely administrate machines "independent[ly] of an operating
system."  Can you only imagine having your computer hacked not just
at an operating system level, but at a *firmware* level?
How would you even detect that?  This goes well beyond the fears
that first awoke with "Secure Computing."
