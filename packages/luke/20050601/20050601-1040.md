<p>Way back when I was in grade school, there was a significant
amount of opposition to having sex ed in St. Josephs.  Reading some
of the recent townhall.com articles, I begin to see the danger here
that simply was not even envisioned back then.  While I doubt that
even at their worst, any of the Catholic Schools have anything even
approaching the horrors that Ms. Janice Shaw Crouse documents,[1] I
<em>do</em> see the rise in outcome-based-education type initiatives
in the Catholic School system here to have a significant potential
for state or federal regulation of the Catholic school systems
much along the lines of the "Standards of Learning" tests now
mandated for the public schools.  Such regulation would eventually
contain mandates for programs such as those that Ms. Crouse rightly
denounces.</p>
