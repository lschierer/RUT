<blockquote markdown="1">According to the most recent figures from the Vatican yearbook of statistics, the number of the world's population that are Muslims is 19.2%, with the number of Catholics trailing behind at 17.4 %. [^200803311]</blockquote>

[^200803311]:  Catholic News Agency.  "Vatican: Muslims now outnumber Catholics"  www.catholicnewsagency.com  2008-03-31 <http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12192>

This is attributed to the failure of Catholics and other Christians to reproduce, a failure that is not shared by Muslim families.   This will have huge societal implications as we age.
