<p>The Catholic News Agency (CNA) looks at the tendency to abort children with Down Syndrome as a reflection of the societal view, echoed rather more strongly in many parts of the biology community, that these lives are not worth living.<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5203" title="Pre-natal testing: weeding out society's undesirables?">[1]</a></sup> These children may not be able to achieve so much in today's technology and science driven world, but they are still able to love and laugh, hurt, mourn, and cry. They are still human and deserving of better than to be brutally killed in the earliest and most defenseless months of their lives.</p>  <font size="-2"> <ol> <li>Catholic News Agency.
