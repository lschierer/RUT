<p>I rather expected this, but its still sad to see. Apparently, if Justice O'Conner's seat on the court is not to go to a woman (highly preferred option), then it must at least go to someone who would vote the same way she would have (implication is that no woman would vote differently).<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1124442315124&rss=newswire">[1]</a> This is sad.  Can we then only replace Justice Thomas with another black person?  Is the Supreme Court unjust because there is no "Hispanic-American" or "Chinese-American" on it?  What about black women, are they adequately represented by a white woman?  Do you not see how ridiculous this is&#x203d; If we are truly equal, we are truly represented regardless of the ethnicity or gender of the person on the bench.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Yen, Hope.
