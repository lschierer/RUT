Olmsted of Phoenix Arizona for defending the Church's teaching that abortion is inherently evil and that those who support it should not be given a platform to speak by the Church.<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4696">[1]</a> Hopefully those attacking him will recognize the internal consistency of his stance, though I do not expect they will.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Catholic News Agency.
