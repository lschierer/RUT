Lauren, the most wonderful girl in the world, is no longer my girlfriend: she is now my fianc√©e!!!!

<strong>update 2006-08-28 1904 EDT</strong>  Some pictures are up <a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/photos/engagement/engagement.html">here</a>.  None of the ring yet, as we were using Lauren's camera, and she prefers not to be in pictures.  As a result, many of the ones she took remain on my computer, but not up on the website.  I see little point in pictures of me, no one but Lauren wants to look at them anyway. ;-)

<strong>update 2006-08-28 2053 EDT</strong>  On second thought, I posted all of them.  It was easier to do that after Lauren sent me the 3 of the ring, than to pick and choose again, esp. as she wanted me to set up a site with pictures with french labels for her grandmother.
