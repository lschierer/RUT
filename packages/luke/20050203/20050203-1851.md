Okay, so that was odd.  Turns out Mom's problem with email was that
it wasn't actually sending it, <strong>and</strong> thunderbird
wasn't telling her that it was not sending.  At some unknown point
in the past when our ip address changed, and my server stopped
forwarding mail for the house, thunderbird didn't start popping up
error messages as it normally does.  Very odd.  So I upgraded her
thunderbird version from something to 1.0, and then resent all her
email from the 24th on, since the last she remembers getting replies
was the 22nd (and apparently she didn't send anything on the 23rd).
