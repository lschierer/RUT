April Fools day passed uneventfully, in that nothing april-fools-day-ish happened.  Lauren did not even realize that it *was* April Fools Day until it was nearly bedtime.  This makes me happy.  I am not at all a fan of April Fools Day.

Too bad that it will be on a Monday next year.  It will no doubt intrude on my life more significantly.
