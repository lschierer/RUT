I no longer read as much as I once did.  I finish perhaps little
more books each year than I once read in a month.  This is somewhat
depressing, but also reflects a life in which I am out more.  I did
not have a computer when I read that much, I rarely went out with
friends (really, did not at all).  Still, George Weigel reminds me
how much there is still to read, and gives a nice set of names and
a few titles as a starting place.[^1]
