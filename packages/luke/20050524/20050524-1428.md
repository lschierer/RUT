<p>Congress is trying to push through a bill to create federal
funding for embryonic stem cell research.[1] This move comes with
lots of promises of future cures, at the cost of lives, but no
results <em>at all</em> so far.  The promising treatments from
stem cells to date come from adult stem cells and from umbilical
tube stem cells, neither of which cost a life to obtain.  This is
then thus simply an attempt by materialist and atheist scientists
to further desensitize to death.</p>
