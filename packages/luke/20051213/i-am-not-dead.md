<p>It has been a while since I have posted.  I mostly write stuff up, mostly read the stuff I write up, in scraps of time at work while waiting for this or that to compile or download, or simply run. But with the move from Reston to Tyson's, work has been a mess. We have insufficient power and no Internet at the new office, but are totally out of the old one as the lease was up at the end of November.  While this technically means I have had more time, I also have better uses for my time than reading news here at the house.</p>
