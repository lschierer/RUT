Okay, so I was mistaken about there not being anything particularly
note worthy today.  While not hugely significant, I realized as I
was inserting this into the previous post that I have more to say
than I'd initially thought, and thus that it should be in its own
post so that I can cleanly refer back to it if I want to.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.ncregister.com/current/0206lead1.htm">Dozens
of Episcopalians Follow Leader into Catholic Church</a>" and "<a href="http://www.ncregister.com/current/0206lead2.htm">Married
Priests? The English Experience</a>" are a pair of articles
from the <a href="http://www.ncregister.com">National
Catholic Register</a> on married priests in the western or
Roman Rite of the Catholic Church.  Much food for thought, I
can't quite make out where the first article is coming from,
the second one I think the author is reluctantly coming down
against it.  This is one of the more controversial topics in
the Church right now, and it kind of relates to Ederlyn's "<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/baranoouji/186084.html">Attempted
virtue is its own punishment, I
think.</a>."  Specifically she links to "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64112-2004Aug13.html">What
Is the Vatican Saying About Women?</a>" which is an odd
run down of some of the things the Vatican is currently
saying about women.  I have no clue how accurate it is,
so I'll take it at its word for the most part for now.
But towards the end I do take issue with it, and thus with
the one line of comments on Ederlyn's post.  There seems to be
a prevailing thought that Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter, "<a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html">Ordinatio
Sacerdotalis</a>," is not in fact the final word on the subject of
the ordination of women, but is only the final word of Pope John Paul
II's pontificate.  I suppose people either have trouble grasping
the idea of infallibility, which I could sympathize with, or they
find the language at the end of the letter to be less than the bar
for infallibility to be invoked.  I'm really rather curious which
is the case, but not sufficiently so to come out and ask directly.
It seems rather to make the doctrine meaningless to require more
than he has said:

<blockquote>Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed
regarding a matter of great importance, a matter which pertains to
the Church's divine constitution itself, in virtue of my ministry of
confirming the brethren (cf. Lk 22:32) I declare that the Church has
no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and
that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's
faithful.</blockquote>

And I know that there is a tendency to raise the bar so high it
cannot be met, in part because of our own unwillingness to accept
it, and in part to make reconciliation with the protestants easier.
For they should have no trouble accepting a doctrine that in practice
never comes into play.  And how much easier it would be to invent
our own morality, to decide for ourselves what is right and wrong,
acceptable and unacceptable, possible and impossible, if there is
no one who can absolutely say "this is what is."  Not that I think
such thoughts are in the forefront of people's minds when they
ignore infallibility or make it impossible to invoke, I doubt they
are consciously denying the existence of absolute right and wrong
at all.  Rather, I would tend to think they are simply subconsciously
denying their <em>own</em> error, and thus if they are not in error,
the contradicting statement must be.<br  /><br  />

All of this most likely sounds incredibly haughty on my part, as if
I were full of myself and my own correctness.  I do not, however,
mean to sound that way.  Perhaps it is I who am wrong, and the bar to
infallibility really does require more.  If so, I'd question why our
Holy Father worded his statement the way he did, but there could be
other reasons for having done so.  Perhaps the Holy Spirit intervened
so far and no further, a just-enough intervention.  It is certainly
one conceivable explanation.  Perhaps it is a bad translation,
or my own misuse of language that leads me to read an absolute
meant as such in that paragraph.  I do not think so, but I accept
the possibility, and if you want to argue otherwise, I'd be curious
to hear your rationale (so long as it <strong><em>is</em></strong>
rational ;-).  I promise to try my best not to bite your head off
if you, whoever you are reading this, choose to email me over it.
