<p>Spent some time looking at grim's nascent gobjectification of the buddy list in Gaim today.  Its been quite some time since I have seriously looked at C.  I need to get my head back into it. Plus, I am starting to lose touch with the code base, with the many API changes going on, between gobjectification, status, and never having extensively worked with some of the other changes we have done lately.  All in all a good thing.</p>  <p>I have not posted as much about the news lately.  I am starting to reach that point where the news simply depresses me without sparking an incredible motivation.  This usually happens when I read news for an extended period, usually much sooner than it has this time around. Between what William has sent me, and what I have seen on my own, quite a few Bishops are starting to speak up about evolution. Its good to see, they are hitting a very consistent like, much the line I have been taking happily.  Pretty much everything else is bad though.  The hurricane is causing predictable but wrong reactions (more federal spending, the government can solve everything &#x2026; yeah. right. whatever.), the Supreme Court nominations are also going much as expected, with few important questions answered. Science continues to push the bounds of what is possible, and seems to find any justification sufficient to pursue any given line of research.  But that is also, unfortunately, not new.</p>  <p>Outside of Gaim, which is going incredibly slowly, my personal life is going fairly well.  But that isn't something I tend to talk much about here, and I do not intend to change that pattern. As a result, posts have been somewhat sparse.</p>
