Global warming is real.  We have not seen it in much of the recent data[^200708101],  the ice at the antarctic is increasing[^200708102], and other parts of the southern hemisphere are getting colder also,[^200708103] but it is real.  Scientists everywhere assure us of this fact.

Not only is it real, but it is our fault.  It does not matter that some of the data from Mars indicates that Mars might be warming also.[^200708104]  This does not matter; the greenhouse gases we produce *must* be the cause.

That is why even though scientists are now sure that their models underestimated the role of various natural weather variations, and that a new model that tries to take them into better account predicts no warming for at least another 2 years, we can be sure that after that things will get *really bad.*[^200708105]  We should trust this model, even though none of the previous ones have been all that accurate. 

This incredible explanation is why I have taken the time to recap some of the highlights of the last year or so  of following this issue.  While scientists have tried to refute the role of the sun in the Earth's climate (an article I regrettably lost the link to before I had a chance to write about it), they have ignored (so far as I have seen following only the public news) the data points I have listed here.  It seems to me that what we do *not* know about climate *far* eclipses what we *do* know about it, and that any gloom and doom projection should be taken with a large grain of salt.  

Particularly when it is saying, in essence, "we know we have been claiming it will get warmer for years now.  It has not really gotten any warmer, but just keep paying us, it will any year now."
