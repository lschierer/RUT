Yesterday in science news, I read something quite exciting.  Scientists have discovered "a vast water reservoir beneath eastern Asia that is at least the volume of the Arctic Ocean."<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  I cannot believe that this is the only such subterranean water mass.  Even if it is the biggest, this marks proof that there could exist substantial amounts of water that we simply do not see.  How much have they looked for bodies of water like this?  What if the water were even further down, would it show up differently, be harder to detect?  All sorts of questions.

One thing is certain though.  An ocean's worth of water is decidedly non-trivial.  Even spread around the world, it *must* be the case that so much water would make at least some difference in the sea level.  How much?  Could this be a more rational explanation for where some of the water for the Flood came from?  

Oh, and I have marked this as "plate tectonics" because that is what the article is concerned with.  The idea that this sort of water could help "lubricate" the plates, making it possible for them to move and shift and so on.  They could be right.  I do not know.  Even if they are, I persist in thinking that earthquakes must have other causes.  But that is an entirely other topic.
