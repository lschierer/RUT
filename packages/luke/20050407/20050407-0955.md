I have expressed concerns about how realistic the movie "Gatica" can
look.  "<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7410891/">Labs selling
DNA assessments</a>" is perhaps the most compelling example of this
yet.  It is a short step from offering this sort of genetic testing
to insurance companies requiring it and basing rates off of it.
While the Senate ban on genetic discrimination (logged <a href="./view.php?date=

but apparently no longer available on findlaw <font size="+2">&#x2639;</font>) might help prevent, or at least slow,
this, I think it likely that we will see it in other places and
slowly introduced here as well.</p>
