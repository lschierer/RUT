Drilled to Bottom of Earth's Crust, Breakthrough to Mantle Looms</a>"
reports:</p>

<blockquote>Already the types of rocks recovered show that
conventional interpretation of Earth's evolution are "oversimplifying
many of the features of the ocean's crust," said expedition leader
Jay Miller of Texas A&amp;M University. "Each time we drill a hole, we
learn that Earth's structure is more complex. Our understanding
of how the Earth evolved is changing accordingly."</blockquote>

<p>Barbara John, a different scientists involved, continues:</p>

<blockquote>"We need to evaluate all the data we have from the cruise
and re-analyze the seismic data, to determine whether it's better to
deepen the current hole or drill elsewhere, or maybe even collect
additional seismic data to better constrain where to drill," John
told LiveScience. "Our major result is that we've recovered the lower
crust for the first time and have confirmed that the Earth's crust
at this locality is more complicated than we thought."</blockquote>
