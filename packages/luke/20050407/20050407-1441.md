<p> I found <a href="http://www.reformationtestimony.org.nz/Essays2/Pontifex%20Maximus.htm">this
rather irate article/post</a> off of Ederlyn's blog.  I have read
about such people more than once, but never seen a real example
of it before.  Someone who really considers the pope to be "the
man of sin."  While I agree that it is rather silly for Mrs. Bush
and Ms. Rice to be wearing veils the way a devote Catholic might
(which is not to say that every female who doe not is not devote,
I simply mean that the ones who do tend to be), I think he is
being more than a little prideful and/or deliberately obtuse not to
realize that we kneel in prayer to God <em>for</em> the Pope John
Paul II, not <em>to</em> him.  However, protestants, and especially
evangelicals, fail to understand our communion with the saints,
and the conversation we hold with them, asking their intersession
before Christ for us, so I guess it is not too much of a stretch
to see this cluelessness.</p>

<p>On a side note, this article provides some timely proof that the
"Separation of Church and State" here in the United States has been
badly perverted.  Do you think Washington or Madison intended that
the President should not be able to kneel in Church?</p>
