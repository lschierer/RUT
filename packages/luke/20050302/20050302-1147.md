<p> In yet another example of scientists realizing that their
models have left significant events out of the equation, "<a href="http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050301_ozone_thinning.html">Sun's
Temper Blamed for Arctic Ozone Loss</a>" talks about the unexpected
nature of the Arctic ozone loss this year.  Apparently we didn't
expect the Sun to play a role.  Will they revise the Antarctic
models because of this?  Perhaps CFCs are not as significant as
previously thought?</p>
