Spent some time today trying to get alpine's webmail component up and running.  I am pleased to see that the authors of pine are coming out with a webmail that should work with my maildir setup.

Still, at the same time, I ought not to have worked on it just now.  I need to find some time to work on the Gaim ->Pidgin change for the 1.5.1 tree.  I had hoped to make significant progress on it today, but did not.  Alpine was a more interesting project, as necessary as the name change is.
