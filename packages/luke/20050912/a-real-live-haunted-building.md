<p>A landlord is <em>suing</em> a pair of restaurateurs for refusing to occupy his building.<sup><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1126256710546&rss=newswire">[1]</a></sup> The pair, who are Jehovah's Witnesses, refuse to do so because of consistent and numerous reports that the building is haunted. They claim that their faith requires they avoid a haunted building; regardless, I cannot say I blame them.  Even if entirely untrue, this sort of reputation would quite conceivably have an effect on their business.  The owner apparently offered to have an exorcism performed, but that, being a Catholic rite, was not considered sufficient or acceptable to the pair.</p>  <p>Overall, my reaction is that this is bizarre.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] The Associated Press.
