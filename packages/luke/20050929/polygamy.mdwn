In a turn of events that bodes ill for all, it appears that the Dutch have decided to legalize polygamy.<sup><a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/301">[1]</a></sup>  I bet the Mormons and the Muslims will waste no time jumping on this new "right."  How long until we see a push for this here I wonder?  Heaven help us when it comes.
