<p> Kathleen Parker is apparently a rather exceptional
woman.  She thinks that fathers are not useless,
that men have a point, a value, an reason for being
beyond mere procreation.  She makes this evident in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/kathleenparker/kp20050302.shtml">Undoing
the damage of male-bashing, one daughter at a time</a>," an article
that warms my heart to read.  What is more amazing is that a
college professor, a female college professor, actually agrees
with this heretical idea, and is teaching a class based on it.
And isn't being fired.  There are some interesting statistics here,
and I'm somewhat tempted to get the book it mentions.  It would be
yet another on my unending to-read list.</p>
