learning from the collective</a>" once again brings us an example
of basing our robots off of nature.  If this works, if they make
real, useful robots, especially nanotech robots, on these ideas,
we will, once again, be significantly blurring the lines between
life and non-life, intelligence, and what Neil Stephenson would
call "pseudo-intelligence."  Again, I raise the specter of irony:
several hundred years from now, the thought of these robots having
been created will be as ludicrous to "science" as the thought
of man having been created is now.  Of course this implies a
break down of history at some point, so that things must needs be
rediscovered.  Any number of things could cause that though, give
or take a thousand years and you might not even need a breakdown,
just the normal blurring of time and the change of preferred format
for information.</p>
