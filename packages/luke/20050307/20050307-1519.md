<p> In "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/richtucker/rt20050304.shtml">Judge
not</a>," Rich Tucker agrees with the overall line of thought in
my <a href="./view.php?date=20050304-1517">Friday, 4th of March
2005 15:17</a> post.  The decision that the Supreme Court made
was all well and good, rational people can argue back and forth.
The rationale they used is, however, a horrid continuation of making
up things on the fly.</p>

<p><strong><big>Update: 20050307-1548</big></strong> David Limbaugh's article, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/davidlimbaugh/dl20050304.shtml">The new age Supreme Court</a>," also agrees.</p>

<p><strong><big>Update: 20050307-1614</big></strong> as does Mark Alexander in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/markalexander/ma20050305.shtml">Judicial supremacists and the despotic branch</a>."</p>

<p><strong><big>Update: 20050308-1142</big></strong> See also George Will's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/georgewill/gw20050307.shtml">Wrong on all counts</a>," Jeff Jacoby's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jeffjacoby/jj20050307.shtml">A phony 'consensus' on youthful killers</a>" and Armstrong Williams's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/Armstrongwilliams/aw20050307.shtml">Judicial tyranny</a>".

</p><p><strong><big>Update: 20050310-1017</big></strong> Edwin J. Feulner's "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/edwinfeulner/ef20050309.shtml">Courting trouble</a>," Jonah Goldberg in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jonahgoldberg/jg20050309.shtml">Upholding Kennedy's brain</a>" and Terence Jeffrey in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/terencejeffrey/tj20050309.shtml">Justice Kennedy should stand for re-election</a>" all chime in also.</p>
