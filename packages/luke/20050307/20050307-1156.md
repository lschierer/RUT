<p> The things we don't know are at times more amazing than the
things we do.</p>

<p>In science news today, apparently stars can be planet
sized, and older bipeds taller than younger ones.  "<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050303_star_small.html">Newfound
Star Smaller than Some Planets</a>" talks about the discovery
of a very "small" star, apparently only a little bit bigger than
Jupiter, though, apparently, denser.  They claim this discovery
helps solidify definitions of planets, stars, and brown dwarfs,
but to me it only seems to confuse things more.  In related news,
"<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/cosmology-05g.html">Spitzer
Space Telescope Finds Bright Infrared Galaxies</a>" talks about the
discovery of some galaxies that are not visible to ground based
optical telescopes.  It seems they are behind a huge dust cloud,
and that they were discovered by an orbiting infrared telescope.
This seems to raise two questions, how much dust is out there,
and how much mass is in other galaxies we can't see?</p>

<p>Also in the news today, we have a palaeontology story.
"<a href="http://cooltech.iafrica.com/science/421933.htm">Oldest
biped skeleton discovered</a>" reports that a number of bones
from a skeleton older than Lucy was found in Ethiopia.  It is
dated "to between 3.8 and four million years old."  Apparently it
walked upright, based on an ankle bone, and was taller than Lucy.
This last is apparently quite a surprise.  But will it change
any theories?  I doubt it.  The BBC also reports on this, in "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4322687.stm">Scientists
unearth early skeleton</a>," but offers nothing more really in the
way of details.</p>
