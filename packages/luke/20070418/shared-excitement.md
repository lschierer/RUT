Fr. Frank Pavone, M.E.V.  shares my excitement and reasoning.<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  He goes on at much greater length, emphasizing the importance of electing pro-life officials, and looking ahead at some of the hints on future progress the decision gives. 

Mr. Wesley J. Smith is cautiously pleased.<sup>[\[2\]][ref2]</sup>  He is concerned that this ruling can be seen as a affirmation of <em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em>.  His legal analysis is not entirely gloomy though; he sees this as a step up, despite the affirmation.
