Mr. Motte Brown does not share my optimism.<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  He rightly notes that this does not really limit access to abortions, and that the alternative procedures are *at least* as gruesome as that which has been banned.  

This is the first ban on abortion in any form to be upheld though.  That is something to celebrate; it would not have happened before President Bush appointed our two newest justices.
