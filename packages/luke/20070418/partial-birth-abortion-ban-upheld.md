"The 5-4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law in 2003 does not violate a woman's constitutional right to an abortion."<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup> This is <strong><em>awesome</em></strong> news!  

It is also just the first step.  Abortion is murder, and until society recognizes that and reacts appropriately, we have a problem.  Still, this is encouraging news.
