<p> Diana West's article, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/dianawest/dw20050411.shtml">Reviewing
the National Review</a>," got me going on what is otherwise
a very slow week for news.  She documents a couple cases of
anti-christian activism, one of which I recall hearing about
but overlooked, and one of which is new to me.  Apparently,
it is vilification, and thus illegal, for a non-Muslim to read
the Koran aloud, or at least certain sections of it that deal
with women.  Who would have guessed?  This rather outrageous idea
was used to prosecute 2 pastors who decided to give a sermon on
Islam, hardly surprising in these days where it is dominating
the news.  Secondly, the Council on American Islamic Relations
(CAIR) is up in arms about two books that the National Review
is selling.  <em><a href="http://www.thbookservice.com/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6614">The
Life and Religion of Mohammed</a></em> by J.L. Menezes,
and <em><a href="http://www.thbookservice.com/<?php echo
htmlentities("BookPage.asp?prod_cd=C6077"); ?>">The Sword of the
Prophet</a></em> by Serge Trifkovic.  These books, I am told,
talk about the dark underside of Islam and Mohammed, including his
taking a <strong>very</strong> young girl as one of his multiple
wives, and other war time activities.  It really says something
when a faith has to use legal action and the threat thereof to
suppress criticism of it.  It says even more of our culture, and of
Australia's culture, that it worked.</p>
