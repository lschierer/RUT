<p>The Knights, instrumental in causing Congress to add the words "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance back in 1954, are now defending their/our achievement according to <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/">CNA</a>.<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4899">[1]</a></sup> This is good to see, as I cannot imagine the school districts fighting this decision as committedly as the Knights will.</p>  <p>On a side note, I did not know that you <em>could</em> ask to become a defendant in a case like this.</p>  <font size="-2"> Catholic News Agency.
