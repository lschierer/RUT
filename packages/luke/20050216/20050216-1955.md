The South Dakota "<a href="http://www.aberdeennews.com/mld/aberdeennews/news/10877880.htm">House
panel approves measure to make abortion a felony"</a>"!!  This is
awesome news!!

<blockquote>The State Affairs Committee unanimously approved HB1249,
which would make it a felony to do abortions if Roe v. Wade, the 1973
U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, is overturned. The
bill would allow exceptions in cases where a pregnant woman's life
is at risk.</blockquote>

Hopefully the full state house, the state senate, and the Governor
of South Dakota will stand up to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood
and pass this as well.
