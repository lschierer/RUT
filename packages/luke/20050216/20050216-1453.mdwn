I first mentioned how the United Nations forces
seem to have an odd idea of appropriate behavior on <a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/view.php?date=20050215-1050">the
15th of February 2005</a>.  Michelle Malkin found
and provides more detail than I was aware of in "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001530.htm">The
U.N.'s Rape of the Innocents</a>" and the associated <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20050216.shtml">column</a>."
Apparently the same types of deviant and unacceptable behaviors
were prevalent in Bosnia as well as the Congo.  And yet the United
Nations continues unabashed.
