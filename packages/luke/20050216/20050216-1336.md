Okay, so if you needed any confirmation, I am now officially an
idiot.  I didn't realize what the orphaned lspdev package was doing
until after I tried to manually delete many of the files removing
it left behind.  Only to realize that I had actually removed pretty
much all of /usr.  Fortunately /home was a different partition,
and dpkg --get-selections > file let me record every installed
package in a way that let me quickly and easily reinstall my system
(quickly because I have a mirror of debian here on the network ;-).
