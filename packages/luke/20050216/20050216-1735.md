Prayer is school is okay&#x203d; Nope, don't get your
hopes up.  Its not happening in school, just on school time.  "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-15-2005/20050215064504_04.html">Va.
School Board OKs Keeping Bible Classes</a>" contains this interesting
factoid, along with the legal challenge to the practice.  Still,
this is an interesting step forward for a public school system to be
sufficiently under parental control as to recognize the importance
of religious education.  Lets hope they win the right to continue.
