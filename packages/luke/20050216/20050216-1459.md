Anyone interested in cryptography will be interested in "<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html">SHA-1
Broken</a>" from Bruce Schneier's "<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Schneier on Security</a>" blog.
The related research paper is not out yet apparently.  I really do
need to get "the code book," a book on quantum ciphers that Chris
Ruark recommended.
