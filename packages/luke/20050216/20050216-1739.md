In science today, we have "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4269299.stm">Age
of ancient humans reassessed</a>" and "<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_life_050216.html">Exclusive:
NASA Researchers Claim Evidence of Present Life on Mars</a>."  The
first pushes the origin of <em>Homo sapiens</em> back 40,000 years.
Even though not mentioned, this means that <em>Homo sapiens</em>
overlapped with earlier "ancestors" even more significantly.
The latter talks about finding methane on Mars, which is apparently
being taken as an indication of life on Mars.
