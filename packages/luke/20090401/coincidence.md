[This][this][^20090331-1] comes only a week or so after I finished the book, <em>Lord of the World</em>[^20090331-2] that it compares President Obama to.  The author writes reflecting much the same line of thought that I had as I wrote it.

Other than the fact that the "planes" in the book flap wings, and the references to esperanto, the book *is* rather eerie when you think about it having been written in 1906 or so.
