<p>Ever a fan of quizzes, I found one from Mrs. Michelle Malkin's web
log.[1] It classifies me as an "Enterpriser,"[2] quickly scanning
the site, I differ from what it calls a "Social Conservative"[3]
primarily on immigration, where, while I tend to generalize more
than some people like, I tend to see that immigrants are, by and
large, harder working with a stronger concept of morality (less
"tolerance") than many if not most native born Americans are.</p>
