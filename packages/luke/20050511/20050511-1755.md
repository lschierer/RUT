<p>Robots reproduce![1] This would likely be useful, it should
eventually lead to robots that can self-repair, and, as it
is miniaturized, to specialty robots that build other things.
Think <em>Diamond Age</em>.  On the other hand, it still tends
towards my overall worry that several hundred years from now, we
will think that robots evolved.  I would like to think there will
continue to be a clear distinction between life and its simulation
(robots, AI, both).  I worry that might cease to be.</p>
