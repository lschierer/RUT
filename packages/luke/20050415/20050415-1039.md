<p> I remember that there was once this thing called a legal
separation, where you were still married, but not living together.
It was tried before divorces, and it better reflected the
reality of marriage, at least from my Catholic perspective.
Divorce <strong>is</strong> merely a legal separation, you are not
then unmarried, you are not then able to marry again.  You do not
hear about legal separation any more, just divorce.  Why is that?
The reason I ask is that in Oregon, have passed a bill to allow for
divorce when the woman is pregnant.  Apparently this was needed to
protect women in abusive relationships.  One would think that there
would be other ways short of divorce to do that, no?  Details are <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-15-2005/7f41000b631d7f5c.html">here</a>.</p>
