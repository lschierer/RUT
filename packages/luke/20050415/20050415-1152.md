<p> In right to life news, "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-15-2005/5101000a3dfa0d22.html">Texas
OKs Life-Without-Parole Jury Option</a>" reports that Texas is
considering giving juries an option to sentence people to life
without parole as an alternative to the death penalty.  If this
passes, only New Mexico would have a death penalty without offering
this morally acceptable alternative.  Pray that the Texas House
passes this bill and the Texas Governor signs it.</p>
