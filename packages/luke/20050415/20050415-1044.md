<p> "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-15-2005/8d5c000a2296a4d8.html">Appeals
Court Rules Against Wiccan in Va.</a>" shows an appellate court
getting things right for a change!  A Virginia county barred
a Wiccan priestess from giving the opening invocation because
Wiccans are not consistent with the Judeo-Christian understanding
of God.  The Appeals court upheld this, saying that as the county
has a wide range of faiths represented, they are meeting the
Constitutional requirement.  If this reaches the Supreme Court,
it will, no doubt, be overturned, as their decisions tend to go
towards an anti-Christian understanding of that Amendment.  Still,
it is nice to see that one court, at least, understands things.</p>
