<p>Ms. Barbara Perry thinks that if Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court is confirmed, that it will signal/mean that there is no more anti-Catholicism with respect to the Supreme Court at least.<sup><a href="http://news.webindia123.com/news/showdetails.asp?id=151671&cat=World" title="Catholic majority seen for Supreme Court">[1]</a></sup> I disagree.  I think that the very fact that his faith has been raised and noted means that it is and continues to be an issue even if his nomination does get through.</p>  <font size="-2"><ol><li>WebIndia123.com.
