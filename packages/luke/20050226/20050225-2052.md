Okay, so I just had a panic moment, I booted my machine back up (long
story why it was down, I may write that up after), and had no sound.
I'm at a total loss here, it was working fine before rebooting.
Note, this is the first reboot since having converted from Ubuntu
to Debian.  I look at the modules, everything seems fine, but I'm
getting a snd_ctrl_open error which I have no clue what is, but
looks like a kernel module error to me.  So I poke around loading
extra modules, no luck.  I start googling, and one guy asks about the
output of alsamixer.  Now, I have an alsamixergui, but no alsamixer;
what's up with that?  Its very weird, that's what it is, Linux always
comes with a command line client before a graphical one.  So just for
kicks, I install alsa-utils, and guess what? it's pulling alsa-base
and several other packages I'd have sworn I'd had.  Apparently in
the conversion from Ubuntu to Debian, they were uninstalled.  So a
second reboot later (that being the easiest way to make sure the
modules and alsabase and everything are all in sync that I know of,
though I'm sure the reboot wasn't necessary), I again have sound. :-)
