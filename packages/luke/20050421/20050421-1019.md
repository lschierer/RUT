<p> In a remarkable display of speculation and specious logic, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4461827.stm">Odd fly
uncovers evolution secret</a>" equates the presence of biodiversity
with its cause.  This is a nice example of begging the question,
and leads me to ask, just how credulous do they think we are?  Well,
given the infinite capacity for stupidity, probably only about half
as silly as they should.</p>
