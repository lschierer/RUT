<p> Robert Novak briefly <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20050418.shtml">mentions</a>
that it is not only the Muslim population that Israel is giving a
hard time.  Their security practices are impacting the ability of
Christians, primarily Catholics and Orthodox, to live and prosper
as well.  It is important to remember that just as the Muslim
population wants an end to Israel, so too does Israel really want
an end to anyone non-Jewish living in Israel.</p>
