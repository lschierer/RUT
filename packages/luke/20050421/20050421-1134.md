Phyllis Schlafly is on questionable grounds for a "conservative" in her [recent
article](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/ps20050418.shtml).
She comes out strongly in favor of the REAL ID Act (H.R. 418).  She states:

> All but 10 states already require driver's license applicants to prove legal
> presence in the United States. All but 14 states require verification of at
> least one of the documents applicants produce, and 22 states and the District
> of Columbia require licenses to expire with temporary visas.

> The states that don't currently have these standards are a magnet not only for
> illegal immigrants, but also for foreign terrorists and U.S. criminals and
> identity thieves. Congress has a duty to close these monumental gaps in our
> national security, and the Senate should promptly pass the REAL ID ACT.

Where in the constitution does Congress have this duty imposed?  Under what
article and section does it have the authority to mandate standards for
identification?  When did we delegate to the Federal government such regulation
of our own citizens?  Make no mistake about it, for all she rests her argument
on the fact that illegal immigrants can now obtain a driver's license, this
would be regulating the lives of you and I.  This moves us closer to a "National
ID," something I have fairly consistently opposed.  What difference would there
be between that and an internal passport except that you wouldn't need the visa
stamp pages?  In that light, the clear course is to maintain control over
identification at the state level, we should be working to *remove* the federal
government from such matters, not *increase* its role.
