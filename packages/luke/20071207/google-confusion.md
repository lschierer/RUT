The street that my mother-in-law-to-be lives on is new, so I can understand and accept that Google Maps does not know about it yet.  What frustrates me though is that there is an *identically* named street in a zip code that happens to be only about 20-30 minutes away from her house, said zip code differing from hers by exactly one digit.  To add insult to injury, the difference is that between a '3' and a '4', making it all the more reasonable for Google to have assumed that this was a typographical error on my part. 

Still, despite knowing exactly how reasonable Google is being, I am annoyed at the error.     What makes it worse is that there's no good way to report this new road to Google, or at least not one that is readily evident from their Maps website.   If I were a business, I could report my location to them, but a new residential street.
