If you want to argue that discrimination against women is alive and real, there is at least one area of life where I will most certainly agree: there is very real discrimination against prenatal girls.<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  Unlike most other forms of discrimination, this version is invariably fatal.  In some areas of the world, this form of discrimination is so severe that 150 boys are being born for every 100 girls.  This will, as these children age, translate into only 2/3rds of the young men being able to find brides.

This phenomena is well documented in China, which is no doubt one of the areas where it has reached that 150/100 ratio. Less known though is the fact that it is a growing trend in India, and that it is starting to crept up in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and nearly every African state.  In other words, we are increasingly seeing a world-wide tendency to kill female children.  This will inevitably backlash against the overall population of the countries in question, but since our elites are concerned about the mythical idea of overpopulation anyway, this will no doubt be lauded.

What had not occurred to me earlier is the reality that this will no doubt lead to increased slavery (of women), and of more women being abducted and abused.

A high cost indeed for those advocating the idea that they have a freedom to chose to kill their baby.
