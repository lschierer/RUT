<p> <a href="./view.php?date=20050308-1043">A while back</a> I
mentioned Warren Farrell's <em>Why Men Earn More: The Startling
Truth Behind the Pay Gap and What Women Can Do About It</em>.  "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/johnleo/jl20050314.shtml">A
wage gap?</a>," by John Leo, brings this book back up, quoting
rather more statistics than the previous article did.  The book
remains recommended reading.</p>
