<p> If you read past the bias in "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4349133.stm">
New row on climate 'hockey stick'</a>," you'll note that there are
significant concerns about the validity of the models that show a
dramatic increase in temperatures since 1900.  Two points stood out.
One: they were looking for a "hockey stick" pattern.  Two: phenomena
that we have fairly reliable historical records for, such as the
unusual warm period from 800AD to 1400AD and the unusually cold
period from 1600AD to 1850AD do not show up in the standard results.
One of the controversial paper's authors states that "uncertainties
in the methods used for climatic reconstruction underestimate the
changeability of climate in the past." Hmmmm. Sound at all like
there is a presupposition that only man can change the climate?</p>
