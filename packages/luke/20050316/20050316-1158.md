<p> "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51//03-15-2005/e08c00071b19f550.html">Critically
ill baby dies after being removed from life support in Texas</a>"
should horrify you.  It should horrify you that it has happened
at all.  It should horrify you even more that it has happened here
in the United States.  Doctors can now, in Texas at least, override
your wishes about your children's health, and what medical treatment
they receive.  A doctor can decide that efforts to preserve your
life are "useless" and let you die sooner and faster.  How long until
we start defining down "useless" efforts and "worthless" lives?</p>
