<p> A new advance in portable shelters is discussed in "<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66872,00.html">Need
a Building? Just Add Water</a>."  A pair of British engineers have
thought up the idea of reinforcing a standard tent with cement,
resulting in a setup where you wet the material, inflate it,
and then allow it to dry, giving you the equivalent of a portable
building. Very cool.</p>
