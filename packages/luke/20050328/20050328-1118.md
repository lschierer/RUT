<p> I have not, however, been producing valid xhtml.  To do so,
I need to remember to url encode my links, and also, apparently, a
"blockquote" cannot appear inside a paragraph.  I have to end the
paragraph, start the blockquote, and then start a paragraph after
ending the blockquote.  The logic appears to be that the blockquote
can contain paragraphs, so a paragraph cannot contain a blockquote.
That sort of makes sense, I guess, but it is logically inconsistent,
as, when writing, I generally continue the previous paragraph
after the blockquote.  This follows from years of highschool and
college writing.  Still, since in web pages I use a block format,
not indenting my paragraphs, it visually produces the correct output
this way, so it matters little.</p>
