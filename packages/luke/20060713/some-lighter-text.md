<a title="Postcards · from · the · Way · to · Armadillo" href="http://damian792.livejournal.com/">Damian</a>'s<sup>[1]</sup> recent facelift prompted me to overcome ennui and lighten the text on my own site.  It occurred to me over a month ago that it was hard to read in a brightly light room or in the presence of glare on the monitor.  I ought to push the change out to the rest of ~luke, but that would take more effort:  I would have to change a number of pages since I never set up a style sheet for anything but this wordpress theme.
