<p>It is nice to see a lucid and well written article supporting "intelligent design" in the media.<a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=8543">[1]</a> I do not know much of anything about the American Spectator, so I cannot evaluate how typical or atypical the decision to include this article is for that publication.  Regardless, it is a well written summery of the movement, and where things stand, and well worth reading.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Peterson, Dan.
