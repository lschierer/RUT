I learned today that Congressman Henry Hyde has died, and gone to meet his Maker.[^200711301]  Congressman Hyde once either said or wrote (I do not know which)

<blockquote markdown="1">When the time comes, as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates, you are there alone standing before God — and a terror will rip your soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there'll be a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world — and they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, ‘Spare him, because he loved us!’[^200711302]</blockquote>

I know that, if his thought be at all accurate, then surely the unborn spoke for him.  I pray God that Congressman Hyde finds his rest in Heaven.
