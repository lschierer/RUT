Today in the logs I notice that Verizon is denying all mail from [pidgin.im](http://pidgin.im).  While less than pleased with this, I am also reluctant to jump through hoops for every ISP out there.  We run very standard mailing list software (mailman), and with the sole exception of having migrated users over from the gaim-*@lists.sf.net mailing lists, you are only getting mail from us if you asked for it in some form.

Coming now, instead of last week, I suspect that this is *not* due to the vast amount of mail caused by importing stuff from subversion into monotone.  Were it coming then, I would sympathize with the ISP.  Even sane admins would balk at several thousand emails for a given user suddenly appearing without warning.  Our mailing list traffic this week has been rather normal though, so I can only conclude that Verizon is reacting in a somewhat draconian manner.

If you are a Verizon user, and are not getting mail from us, I suggest you contact Verizon and take this issue up with them.
