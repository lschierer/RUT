Boundless' <i>The Line</i> hosts some odd topics for a Christian site now and then.  Not odd in that as Christians we do not have something to offer on such topics as the war in Iraq, but odd in that you would think that a Focus on the Family site would be more focused than, say, mine site is.  

Today, one of their authors has a series of quotes from an article in which some surprising news from Iraq is reported.[^200708011]  According to this post, we appear to be moving towards a sustainable situation in Iraq, with at least some potential to improve still further.  Mr. Brown, the author, asks "Will the "administration's critics" in Congress ever be able to see beyond their own hatred of Bush to do what's right for the good of the country?"  The answer, I am sad but certain, is "No."

The Democrats in congress have, as a party, disliked the military at least since Vietnam, if not longer.  They would have no interest in seeing our military succeed, being ideologically committed to the idea that it is impossible for the military to do good, even if they had not invested so heavily in saying that the war was a mistake and is not winnable.

That is really all an irrelevant side point though, because the Democrats *have* invested quite heavily in campaigning against the war, and to admit otherwise would be politically unthinkable.  Nor will the Republicans, who are running over each other to flee out of Bush's unlucky shadow, have any interest in forcing these forward strides into the debate, and the public's notice.  

As has so often been the case, our military will suffer, and our foreign policy fail, not because the course we took was an impossible one, but because Congress is too corrupt to carry it out.
