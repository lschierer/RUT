According to [this story][wral1], Weyco Inc. has a policy that prohibits its
employees from smoking, not only on company time, but at all.  Basically
treating it like an illegal drug.  To me this seems like the right approach for
*State* and *Local* governments to be taking; why in the
world are we trying to end smoking by making it prohibitively
expensive and difficult (restricting where you can smoke)?
This seems really misguided.  On the other hand though, banning
drugs hasn't exactly worked now has it?  Much like the prohibition
didn't work.  I don't know what the right approach is.
