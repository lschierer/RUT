I read Oliver North's latest column, [Of faith and
freedom](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ollienorth/on20050122.shtml), over
at [TownHall](http://www.townhall.com). In it, I see that Michael
Newdow, that nutty atheist who tried to get "under God" removed from
the Pledge, and tried to ban mention of God in the inauguration, isn't
the only atheist who feels threatened by a public display of faith on
the part of others. Now I've more or less known this for ages, but for
some reason, it still surprises me every time I see it that people can
think this way. How insecure they must be in their lack of belief, how
shallow they must be that they cannot stand upon their own atheism
when confronted by the belief in God that Christians hold. While this
might superficially seem to be a good thing, in that it should mean
that it is easier to convert them, I don't take it that way. Rather
than thinking it would be easier to convert such an atheist, I think
that he must rather be rabid, and will emotionally react against
anything that hints of faith, without thought. And someone who refuses
to think will not convert, their fear will hold them back. To really
understand the scope of what they are doing, look at what the uproar
would be if the situation was in reverse. They want to forbid us to
mention God in public, as public officials. Think if they were
forbidden to deny His existence in public, or as public officials.
Try to put such a restriction into practice, and you will quickly not
be able to tell the difference between the result and a theocracy.
Which is exactly what atheism would result in, since atheism is just
as much a religious/philosophical belief as monotheism. Shall we
establish, in our zeal to "separate church and state" (a phrase that
is no where in the constitution, but, unfortunately, fairly heavily in
US Supreme Court precedent, and thus in common law), establish a state
atheism? Enforce religion into a "God of the gaps" type practice, with
ever narrowing bounds? I fear that we may yet see the full cost of our
"tolerance," beyond "Catholics" who do not believe what the Church
teaches, but to the point of suppression. Already in some places,
special action is needed, and hopefully will be successful, to allow
the Mass to be said[^20130713-1]. A mention of God in a speech is said to
infringe, a prayer in a public event. Shall a Cross in a skyline be next? How
about a rosary hanging from rear-view mirror in a public parking lot? Sound
paranoid? Would you ever have believed that there would be a challenge to the
right of the President to have a prayer said at his inauguration? I know I
wouldn't have.
