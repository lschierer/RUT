The Attorney General of Nebraska is defending his state's
Constitutional amendment banning homosexual "marriages."[^1] This
was supported by seventy percent of the state's population, but
was struck down by the courts.  I am not really sure how a ban on
homosexual "marriages" or prohibiting such couples from enjoying
other legal protections denies them "participation in the political
process," which was the logic used by the federal judge who struck
it down.  It seems to me they have equal access to the ballot box
still, and equal access to run for office, how exactly are they
being denied participation?
