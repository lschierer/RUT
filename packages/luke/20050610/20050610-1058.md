<p>So apparently,[1] "household" means a married family still in
Florida.  Normally that would please me, but this is just bizarre.
How is that a marriage license is required to limit payments from
an insurance company, when we are seeking to have benefits extend
to those that are merely living together in a so called "committed
relationship?"  I worry that this will be used by homosexual
"rights" activists to further the push for homosexual "marriages."
That being said, the other two judges are exactly right: if you
are not related by blood, adoption, or marriage, you cannot really
be part of the same household.  I am all for extended families,
but including a live-in boyfriend as part of the family is further
than I would be willing to go.</p>
