Since when do doctors get to decide what qualifies as a religion
whose beliefs they must respectâ€½ That is at the heart of
a Texas case in which the state is attempting to take custody of
a 12 year old girl whose parents are opposed to the treatments
being used for her Hodgkin's disease[^1].[^2]  Of the two articles, [one] 
says they are utterly opposed, the [other] says they merely have
unanswered questions.  Either way, it is unacceptable that the state
is interfering in this way.  I am always against state or federal
interference with religious devotion because the same logic that
is used against members of any other faith could one day be used
against Catholics.
