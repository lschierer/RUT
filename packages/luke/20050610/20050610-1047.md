Was the *Lemon* test from the *Lemon v. Kurtzman* case in 1971 a decision of the
Warren court?  "Waiting on the Ten Commandments: High Court Shift or Attorney
Strategy?"[^1] provides more details on the 10 Commandments case than I had
previously heard.  It also talks about some speculation that the *Lemon*
test will be overturned.  The speculation really is guesswork, so not too note
worthy, but it did make me stop and think, hence the question.
