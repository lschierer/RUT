Lauren and I went up to Pennsylvania this weekend to visit my Dad's side of the family, most of whom Lauren has not met.  Grandma hosted a shower for us, at which we also celebrated Aunt Marie &amp; Uncle Joe's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary.  We got to see all the aunts and uncles, and some of my cousins, and had a very good time. <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font>  Chris took some pictures across the day, which he has posted [here](http://www.theschierers.net/gallery/v/Trips_Travel/2007/July+in+McKean/).
