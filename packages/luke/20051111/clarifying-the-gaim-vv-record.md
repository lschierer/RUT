Today I wake up to find that Mr. Peter (Bleeter) Lawler's dissatisfaction with Mr. Sean Egan's decisions as they relate to bringing Gaim some voice/video(-vv) functionality has been taken public.  I should not be surprised, but I rather was.   The first I knew of it was <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=12615" title="Gaim Kills Off Gaim-VV Webcam Support?">this OSNews blurb<sup>[1]</sup></a>.  That in and of itself is likely, even had I not made the mistake of posting to the list about it, enough to ensure this reaches <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot</a> and causes a rampage of ignorant users.

The OSNews article links to Mr. Lawler's blog, where his side of the argument is.<sup><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bleeter/12357.html" title="Death of gaim-vv">[2]</a></sup>  He claims it is not an argument,<sup><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bleeter/12981.html" title="gaim-vv death part trois">[3]</a></sup> but his consistent tone throughout has been confrontational.

In one respect he was wrong, I did mean that he ought not to be insulting me in exactly the way he took it at the time.  I was annoyed and upset, and I do not take well to his slander of me.  But then, I also doubt he would have taken that tone had we been face to face.  

But that aside, let the record, as I have seen it these last two days, stand for itself.

<a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/gaimstuff/seanegn-2005-11-10.154044.html">My subsequant conversation with Mr. Egan</a>.  This second conversation happened several hours later, and I had calmed down considerably from the fustration I felt and unfortunately expressed with Mr. Lawler.
