The [Wall Street Journal][WSJ]'s Mr. Stuart Varney presents a chilling thought in an alleging that the current administration is refusing to allow an unnamed bank to return funds loaned to it.[^20090404-1]  The creditability of the article is reduced by the failure to name the bank or the source.  Still, his logic is hard to deny; President Obama is certainly a socialist.  It is a very scary thought, and I can but pray that it is not true.
