On numerous occasions, I have heard Democrats mock President Bush's speaking ability.  Clearly, the man is not the world's greatest public speaker.  I do not know if he has an actual speech impediment or if he just does not care about the way he sounds, or if some mis-guided analyst  focus-grouped things and came up with the idea that he should not worry about the way he sounds.  It really does not matter.

What is truly bizarre though is that Democrats think they can dismiss his ideas, policies, and even measure his intelligence from this.  I am not sure when medical science proved that everyone who mispronounces words and occasionally stutters is mentally deficient, but I have apparently missed the report.  

I am further not sure when such a blatant ad hominem attack became an acceptable way to refute someone's ideas.  For the record, if you lower yourself to such an attack, you have, in my eyes, demonstrated that you must have nothing meaningful to say against the ideas he presents, stands for, and works to achieve.   You must be so utterly blown away that you cannot even begin to defend your own position.  You posit that he is right, and that you are wrong, but you just do not care. 

That is why I have not really mentioned it ever, though I disagree with the man on immigration, education, and a number of other issues.  I think that I can hold my own, and that my *ideas* are worth considering, are in fact better.  I do not need to attack the *man* and hope that doing so causes people to forget _his_ *ideas.*
