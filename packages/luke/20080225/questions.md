Do you *really* think our public schools are doing a good job?  Keep in mind that most of the teacher's union dollars go to the Democratic party.

Do you *really* want to see our medical system go the way of Canada or the UK?  Keep in mind that 1/4 children in the UK cannot see a dentist because the nationalized health care there is floundering.  Or that a far greater percentage of those who have strokes there die than here, because they cannot get the drugs that would save their lives.  Or a host of other examples. 


I am all for handling social issues.  I just do not think that the democratic party's notions of nationalizing everything will by any stretch of the imagination help.  It is a waste of money, and worse, gets in the way of really solving problems. 

But it is beyond that.  Both Democratic candidates are 100% in favor of killing babies.  This is not hyperbole, it is not fiction.  Both will work to expand funding for abortion, help ensure that attempts to restrict it are impossible.  Both will work to export our insanity to other countries such as poor African nations.  Both will make it harder to make people aware of the reality of the choice they are making - to kill their unborn baby.

HOW CAN YOU VOTE FOR THATâ€½  

I simply cannot understand how you can worry about health care or education and sleep nights knowing that you have, with your vote, helped ensure that 1.37 Million[^200802251] babies will be killed next year.  

I am sorry that having that child might impact that mother.  It might reduce her standard of living, remind her of things in her past, change her career plans, or whatever else.  BUT THAT CHILD DESERVES TO LIVE.   Keep that in mind when you proclaim yourself pro-choice, that the child has none. 

And yes, he or she is a child.   He or she is not a mass of tissue.  We can keep him or her alive without the mother for months before natural birth.  He or she has a soul and a life of his or her own, one that is just as important, but a whole lot more defenseless, than that of the mother whose "rights" you are so passionately defending.

Worse though, I think, is if you somehow think that something can be more important than this.  The idea of claiming to be pro-life, but voting democratic sickens me with the thought of that much hypocrisy. 

[^200802251]: Center for Bio-Ethical Reform.  "Abortion Facts."  <http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html>  Just about the first result on Google for "number of abortions per year," I have never actually visited the site before.  I am sure other sites offer other numbers, and that none of them are anything less than hundreds of thousands.
