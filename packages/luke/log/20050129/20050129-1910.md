So I moved Mom over to the new post page I wrote yesterday.
Seems to work well.  Turning off fancy quotes was fairly trivial,
only took me about 5 minutes to find it.  I think the complaints
about it I saw online (none of which told me where to look) where
just MSWord users griping.<br  /><br  />

PVI wrestled Good Council today.  Lost, which wasn't unexpected,
we are giving up too many points because we are short wrestlers.
Such is life, we've got a good batch of kids though, and its a shame
they can't have a few wins under their belt.  Michael lost, but he
didn't show that lost and discouraged look after being taken down
that has cost him so many matches.  Definite improvement.<br  /><br  />

The Smithsonian is picking on one of their researchers
for allowing an Intelligent Design article into a peer
review journal.  Remember, keeping such things out is a
<strong><em>huge</em></strong> part of the materialist defense
against such ideas.  Rather than just debate them on the merits,
keep them out of journals and then tell the world that the
lack of such articles means it isn't "real science."  Details are <a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/3/2005/01/29/the_branding_of_a_heretic_are_religious_">here
