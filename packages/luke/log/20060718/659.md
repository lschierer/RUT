HP has come out with a new chip that might have been designed to foster paranoia.<sup><a title="BBC NEWS | Technology | Tiny wireless memory chip debuts" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5186650.stm">[1]</a></sup>  This new chip, the size of a grain of rice, is powered by induction and contains a wireless antenna for data exchange.  This just <em>screams</em> localizer in a Vernor Vinge<sup><a title="A Deepness in the Sky: A Novel (Zones of Thought) (Mass Market Paperback) " href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812536355/sr=8-4/qid=1153246853/ref=pd_bbs_4/104-8452981-6293526?ie=UTF8:">[2]</a></sup> style.  For while this chip is too big to float through the air, and, at a dollar a chip, too expensive to try to saturate a city even if it were small enough to do so, it is inevitable that with time this technology will become cheaper and smaller.  The idea has now crossed out of science fiction, and I fear there will be no putting the genie back in the lamp.
