## Family Inseparable

### Chapter 7

By: Musings of Apathy  
Edited by Luke Schierer

* * *

"We got our letters! We got our letters!"

"Boys!"

"We got our letters! We got our letters!"

"Fred! George! That's very nice, boys, but if you would just sit down
and open them, you might just know what they actually said," their mum
chastised them.

"But, mum, we haven't finished dancing around yet!"

"Sit down and open your letters. If you are good, I'll let you visit
Gambol & Japes when we visit Diagon Alley for your school lists."

Like two little angels, the twins both immediately took their seats
at the table. Their behaviour was nothing new, however. They fooled no
one. While the twins were opening their letters, Charlie and Percy were
reading theirs, having forgone the theatrics.

"Mum," Charlie called for his mum's attention. "Have you read this?"

"Of course not, dear. What does it say?"

"It's my NEWT classes. I wasn't expecting this," he mumbled, a stricken
look on his face. "I wanted to take NEWT Care of Magical Creatures,
but..."

Molly quickly moved over to see what was the problem. With a flick of her
wand, the bacon and eggs would tend themselves for a few minutes. "What
is the problem, dear?"

"It's the requirements for NEWT Creatures. It says here that there are
weekend trips to some farms and preserves here and in the Carpathians. The
school provides a tent for the students and food, but the portkeys
aren't free and some of the weekend classes have fees," he said,
sounding distraught. His dream jobs all included a requirement of a
NEWT in Care of Magical Creatures. Dragons in Romania, Nundus in Niger,
Sphinxes in Egypt and Chimaera in Greece all required that applicants to
their programs have the more advanced certification before they could
start. "All together, the letter from Professor Kettleburn says that
students must be able to afford seventy galleons in expenses."

"Seventy galleons?" Molly gasped. She took a couple of breaths and
started to go over figures in her head. The great extra expense would
be hard for the family to manage, but they would in the end. Perhaps it
wasn't all needed at the beginning of the year. If it were spread out,
they could come up with the money as they needed. "We'll find a way,
Charlie. You'll get to take that class, if that is what you want to do."

"Mum, George and I have a bit of savings," Fred said while his twin nodded
his head. "It's not much, a galleon and some sickles if it'll help."

"That's very generous..."

"And I have some as well," Percy chimed in. "And I don't need new
books. Bill has all of his old ones. The defence book is the same as he
used in his fourth year, if that's all right with him."

"Sure," Bill agreed. "And I'm making money at the bank, and well, if I
take a lunch with me every day, I really don't have any expenses. What
I make there would help cover."

"And I have money too, mum," Ginny chipped in. She knew that she and Harry
had a sack of galleons in the trunk that they could give. She knew Harry
wouldn't mind. She remembered that Harry was there when he squeezed her
shoulder, as if to agree with her on the use of their galleons.

"That's all very generous, kids," Molly praised her children. "Your
father and I will discuss this, but I don't think that everyone in the
family needs to spend their own money. You all earned that money and
I expect that you have stuff that you need to buy. Percy, don't forget
that you have Hogsmeade trips this year. Is the permission slip in with
your letter?"

"Yes, mum, it is. But I still have money that I can..."

"Not necessary, any of you. We'll work it out."

* * *

After breakfast, Ginny saw Charlie slinking up the stairs to the room he
shared with Ron, her youngest brother. The rest of the Weasleys seemed to
have things to do on the ground floor or outside in the spotty sunshine,
while the weather was not so wet. Faintly, she heard the second step creak
with no one on it, telling her that Harry was heading up the steps as
well. She politely followed after placing her plate in the sink to wash.

In her room she saw the trunk open and could tell that Harry was sorting
their money sack. She closed the door, making sure the latch clicked
closed.

"Harry?"

"Here, Ginny," Harry pulled the cloak off his head so he could speak to
her face to face. "I thought we should give Charlie this money."

"But mum said they were going to take care of it," Ginny reminded him. She
had no hold on the money, but she was used to trusting her mum and dad
to fix things.

"Sure," Harry agreed. "But when we went on a field trip last year,
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon gave Dudley some money so he could have
something to spend on the trip. Is Charlie going to have anything to
spend on his trips?"

"I don't know," she answered. "Okay. I'll give him the money." With
a smile, Ginny kissed her husband on his cheek and took the
moneybag. Without a hesitation, she exited the room and ascended the
step to the room a the top of the stairs.

* * *

"Charlie," Ginny called softly while lightly knocking on her brother's
door.

"What's up, dragonfly?" he answered while opening the door. She followed
him into the room and goggled at the decoration. Surrounding Ron's
bed were posters of the only Quidditch team he supported, the Chudley
Cannons. Her youngest brother had gotten involved with the team when
his uncle took him, and just him, to a game between the Cannons and
the Heidelberg Harriers, a German team. Ginny couldn't explain how the
resounding defeat in an exhibition match had cemented Ron's support,
but it somehow had. Since then, what walls he could were covered in
the most violent orange you could imagine. His older brother who had
to share the space kept it to a minimum, but it still hurt the eyes if
looked at directly.

"I wanted to give you this," she said, thrusting the leather sack into
Charlie's hands.

"What'cha got here? Have you been saving your allowance?"

"Yeah," she said truthfully, although the money sack was barely weighted
by her contribution. The money was hers, as it was Harry's, through
community property, not that either child thought about that.

"Ginny, that is really nice of you..." Ginny interrupted him with a
great hug. She squeezed the life out of him, to which he returned a
firm hug. "But I can't...Mum and Dad are going to take care of it,
you heard her."

"That's alright, Charlie. You're going to all those great places. You'll
need spending money or something."

"But..." he started until she fixed him with a glare, easily communicating
that she had made up her mind. Under her insistent eye, he opened his
trunk and placed the sack of money firmly in the corner, under his
overturned cauldron. "Okay, dragonfly. Maybe I'll find something to get
you in some exotic locale." Ginny gifted him with a smile in return,
one he answered with his own, from ear to ear. "Thanks, Ginny."

* * *

Just after the kids had eaten their lunch, Charlie was drafted to look
after his siblings. His mum was visiting Diagon Alley, although she used
the excuse of stopping at the apothecary rather than Gringotts. Charlie
knew that she needed to check the balance of the family vault to find how
dire his class choice would prove to be. With just a lock-up for wizarding
money, the goblins of Gringotts were there to control access, not keep a
detailed count of a wizard's money. They effected transfers from vault
to vault quite efficiently, and kept records of such transactions very
well, but did not have a record of the value of the interior of any
vault. After all, anyone allowed access to the interior of the vault
could take our or entomb any amount of coins or other objects without
the goblins knowing how the balance had changed. However, for a fee,
any service, including a vault inventory, could be rendered.

"Sweet Merlin," she exclaimed upon opening the Weasley family
vault. Before her stood towering stacks of sickles and knuts. "What on
earth? Did Arthur get a raise and forget to tell me? Have we won the
Galleon Draw and not been notified?"

The escorting goblin paid her no mind, the contents of the vaults being
strictly none of his business. The patrons would have to pay extra for
him to care what they chose to store in their vaults. Thus, anything
Molly Weasley said, in any form of exclamation or surprise, fell on
apathetic ears. What would someone think if goblins started listening
in and responding to the myriad of absently asked questions asked each
day inside the bank. If they wanted questions answered, they could deal
with those grouches on the teller desks. Those guys could really stack
on the fees when the mood hit.

Molly quickly gathered a large sack of sickles and knuts, enough to
handle her purchase at the apothecary and a trip to the alley for the
kids school supplies sometime later. To herself, she thought she should
wait until the mystery of the fattened vault was solved before the yearly
Hogwarts shopping trip. She hoped the reason was found soon, because
the children wouldn't want to wait long with their letters in hand.

As she was exiting the bank, she didn't even think of asking the tellers
to explain the bloated vault contents, knowing of the fees the bank was
known for. Instead, she planned to ask Arthur when he returned home that
evening. Maybe her husband would know about the mysterious good fortune
that had blessed the family.

* * *

While the others were distracted, Ginny slipped into the woods with
Harry carrying a basket filled with her idea of picnic food from the
cold cupboard.

The twins took no notice as they set an old, rusty cauldron to heat
in the middle of the garden, poised over a fire ring built by their
father before they could remember for clear summer nights during the
full moon. They built a small fire with just a couple of split logs and
managed to get the cauldron filled with water from the tap by the shed to
the fire each holding a side. With the cauldron heating and an old book
standing open on a bench, the two ran off to harvest the magical plants
found around the garden and in the nearby wood. Really the variety of
magical plants were a boon for experimental youth such as the twins.

Charlie kept a close eye, but his philosophy of child minding was
to prevent any disasters. At the worst, he knew that the garden and
surrounding area didn't have anything violently reactive, so the twins
would be relatively safe. However, his minding of the twins left Ginny
to her own devices. Charlie knew that she was a generally safe and good
child, so he didn't worry. Besides, the half eye he had to spare was
occupied with Ron's attempt at a simulated war involving a muddy puddle,
a stick that seemed to still have a green leaf or two and two forts he
was building from flat stones and wood from the wood pile.

Harry and Ginny ran along with the picnic basket held between them until
they found a dense enough patch of trees to leave them concealed well
from her brothers or any other intrusion.

As Ginny spread the blanket and set out the food, she asked, "Would you
go and find some more vine like you did before, so we can try that again?"

"Sure," Harry said, standing up and spinning around, trying to get his
bearings. "I don't know ... which ... which way did I go before?"

* * *

Molly Weasley left the bank and made her way to the apothecary for the
very real needs of ingredients for the household. There she took her time
to find the ingredients she needed, still with care as to what would get
the job done most economically. She needed to make more healing potions
to replenish her depleted supplies. Lucky she was a competent potions
student in her day, or a family of nine would be paying a king's ransom
for commercial potions, rather than the more reasonable ingredients.

Throughout her shopping, she could not shake the mystery of the larger
bank account. To tell the truth, it worried her a bit. They needed the
money, but if they spent it and it turned out to be a mistake, they would
have no way of paying it back when the goblins came looking. While they
paid rent on the land the Burrow was built on, Arthur and Molly prided
themselves on being without debt. They had built up their lives and family
without flexing their credit or living above their means. Money was always
tight, but they managed to provide for their children and themselves.

They both loved their children, and loved having so large of a family
around, but it did put a strain on the income at times. Soon ... soon,
Molly knew, her oldest would be moving away from home, just because
that is what adults did. However, with Bill in training at Gringotts,
essentially, the pay was just at a minimum, so it would likely be that
he wouldn't move out until his certification and first assignment as
a full employee of the bank, much to the mother's joy with him being
around for just that little bit longer. One less mouth to feed wouldn't
save nearly anything, not nearly as much as it would effect her and her
husband to have one of their children leave the nest.

* * *

When Harry explored the direction Ginny indicated, he didn't find the
meadow that he remembered from before, just a farmers field on the far
side of the wood they were playing in that stretched quite a ways in each
direction. Nothing he saw would make him think there was a meadow anywhere
in or around the woods behind the Weasley Family house. Nonetheless,
he did find something that would work for the hand-fasting Up in a tree
he could see a large nest, and hanging from the nest was some pale tan
silk, like the sash from a dress.

It didn't take him long to shimmy up the tree; he had lots of practice in
getting away from his cousin in any manner that availed him, and trees
always stumped the rotund boy. He quickly snagged the prize before the
nest's owner could come to reclaim their treasure. Before long he was back
on solid ground and headed back to his wife in the middle of the wood.

"You're back," was his wife's friendly greeting upon his return. "What
do you have?"

"Couldn't find the meadow," Harry explained a bit out of breath. He had
his hands on his knees as he bent over, filling his chest with air. "Found
this though. Think it'll work?"

She took the silken ribbon from him and measured its length with her eye,
finding it satisfactory. "It'll work. Sit down here with me."

They proceeded as they had the first time, this time with the silk rather
than the vine. They were disappointed at first when the ritual wouldn't
work as it had before. Right hands clasped, silk wrapped, vows given
and received, but it didn't respond.

"Maybe it won't work for the right hand again," Ginny thought aloud.

"What about your name?" Harry asked. "What did your grandmum say about
your name now."

"Oh! It's Ginevra Molly Potter, not Weasley. That might be it. Let's
try it on the left with my new name and see if it works."

* * *

When Charlie saw his mum return from the bank, the look on her face
was less than promising. He had hoped that she would return full of
assurances, but instead she looked bewildered and confused. From her
expression, everything had not gone as planned at the family vault,
which didn't leave him very hopeful.

"Mum?" Charlie greeted her. "How was your trip to the alley? Did you
get what you needed from the apothecary?"

"Hmm?" she replied absent-mindedly "Oh, yes I did. It shouldn't be a
problem to replenish the potion cupboard now. I don't know what you boys
get into, but it seems like you use more potions every summer. Were the
others good while you were in charge?"

"Oh, sure!" he replied quickly. "Just ... well ... okay, the twins
needed a minor burn potion each, but we got it all handled. Nothing
serious. Ron's up having a wash-up in the tub. Seemed today was a
mud day."

"At least you could get him to wash with little fuss, I should hope. The
twins aren't trying anything out of your Uncles' book again, are they? I
swear, Fabian and Gideon ran Mum ragged chasing after them when they
were the twins' age. Fred and George seem to be determined to follow in
their fading footsteps."

"What can you expect with a birthday of April 1st? They seem to think
it was an omen handed down by Morganna."

"Merlin save us all," Molly agreed.

"Were you able to take care of the other ... business?" Charlie asked
nervously. "Can ... can I help, any?"

"No dear. No help is necessary. This is your father's and my
responsibility. You don't have to worry about it a bit."

"Okay," he said, accepting his mother's assurances as a son should. "Need
help with anything else?"

"How did you do on burn and scrape potions in class?" she asked, pulling
a number 4 cauldron from the cupboard.

* * *

By the time Arthur returned home, dinner was just coming to the table
and the kids were done with whatever they had been doing throughout the
day. Ron had an extra bath, due to his fascination with playing in the
mud that particular day, and the twins had washed the cauldron they had
used over the fire in the garden at Charlie's insistence. They seemed
happy despite the need for a minor burn potion and the lack of success
at brewing their potion. Charlie was just happy that he had prevented
the ingestion of the sickly brown liquid. He had to shake his head. The
twins were so eager to invent things and have fun. At least they hadn't
used the day to prank any of the family.

"Arthur," Molly said after the rest of the family had cleared out from the
table. "I had to check on the vault balance today, and I got a surprise."

"What was wrong dear? Have we overspent again?"

"Oh, no, not at all. From the looks of things, there was at least sixty
or seventy galleons extra in the vault. I was wondering if you got a
raise at the Ministry and forgot to tell me."

"Well," Arthur contemplated. "It has been a while. Maybe the new fiscal
numbers came in favourably and the Wizengamot approved some for the
department. I'll check with accounting sometime this week to make sure."

"I just didn't want it to be a mistake. The boys received their
letters today, and you know that Charlie selected NEWT Care of Magical
Creatures. Well, there was a letter from Professor Kettleburn about the
additional costs of that course to pay for trips to professional farms
and reserves."

Arthur could see that his wife was a bit distraught, but needed to know
more before he could fix it and give her some substantive comfort. "How
much?"

"Seventy galleons."

"Seems pretty fortuitous, all right, that we have the right amount
extra." Arthur reached his wife's hands on the table across from him
and held them both in his as he reassured her. His composed acceptance
more than anything calmed her. "I'll check with accounting and see if
I never got the notice about a raise, or something."

"And if it isn't?" she asked, still unsure. "I didn't take the kids to
get their books and supplies yet, because I wanted to know how deep we
are going to have to scrape. You know with four in Hogwarts..."

"I know, Molly. It's a lot. I wouldn't worry about where the money
came from. If the accounting department doesn't clear this up, I'm sure
Gringotts can tell us where it came from. I've never known them to make
a mistake yet."

"You're right, but let's wait until the weekend for shopping anyway."

"Probably a good idea."

* * *

As the records of the magical world made their changes to reflect
the day's events, Ginny's acceptance of her new name was recorded. By
using the name Potter as her own in a ritual, she affirmed the change
without ever having to register in person with the Ministry. The same
changes were made in the registry at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. Unseen by school official in Hogwarts or by ministry official
in the Ministry of Magic, Ginevra Molly Weasley was changed to Ginevra
Molly Potter. Strangely enough, if Ginny had used this one opportunity
to state her name as Ginny Molly Potter, she would have never had to
worry about her dislike for the full pronunciation of her first name. She
would have just been Ginny, rather than that being short for something
else. But at eight years old, she didn't even know saying in a ritual
that she was a Potter would effect so many changes.

Just as no official saw that the name had changed, none of her family
could see the pale tan tattoo that now adorned her left wrist. Indeed,
the silk sash was so pale as to be nearly invisible when represented as
a tattoo on her creamy skin. The silk itself would be a keepsake with
the rest of her treasures stashed away in her room.

In the room at the top of a stone tower in an ancient castle, the silver
instrument responsible for monitoring the wards around the Dursley's house
barely flickered.  Harry and Ginny's successive marriages would significantly
complicate any custody case, but had no effect on the very different magic of
blood wards.[^20180709-1]

[^20180709-1]: See [[Notes]] on the wards.

And so, the summer would roll on without the Weasley house guest being
revealed. The steps Harry and Ginny took to ensure this were becoming
automatic in their effort. With a third bonding between them, Ginny
could look Harry in the eye no matter if he was wearing the cloak and
galaxy or not. The differences multiple bondings were making were subtle,
but they certainly noticed them as they added up.

* * *

"Excuse me," Arthur asked at the information desk. Beyond he could see
many other desks covered in parchment and personal nicknacks.

"Yes, how can I help you, sir?" the middle aged man who manned the
desk asked.

"Good afternoon," Arthur greeted, a little kindness could go a good ways
in finding what information he needed. "I needed to enquire about my pay."

"Certainly. Who is your specialist?"

"My specialist?" Arthur asked. "Oh, my. It's been years since I have
been in here. I think it used to be Maryanne, is she still here?"

The clerk huffed out a breath. "No, she retired, the lucky witch, but
she put in a good seventy five, so can't say anything against her for it."

"Hmm. Hope she is enjoying it. Got quite a bit ahead of me before I can
consider that myself."

"As do I. Too many if you ask me," the clerk responded with the full
sincerity of any government employee when discussing how nice life after
the daily grind would be. "Which department are you in, I'll look it up."

"Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. I'm the head."

"Ah, yes ... that's under the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,
isn't it?"

"Yes."

"You're specialist would be Mrs. Whithers. She's at lunch, but you can
request an appointment with her through the normal means, if you wish."

* * *

By the time Arthur was able to make an appointment that wouldn't interfere
with his own work, it was two days later. The woman was curt at best,
but did tell him that a small raise, less than two hundred sickles, had
been approved and sent with his regular pay. Did he not receive a notice?

All in all, the meeting had provided some of the information he wanted,
but not enough to explain the rather larger sum in the vault. The raise,
according to Mrs. Whithers, had only been given starting in July. On
Saturday, which was rapidly approaching, he could go with Molly and
the kids to Diagon Alley and visit the bank to inquire with the goblins
while she took the kids shopping. A solid plan, indeed.

* * *

Arthur would have been glad for the end of the week, come Friday by
five or six in the evening, quitting time, if not for an anonymous
tip that came in to the investigators on the auror squad, giving the
location for some dark artefacts in Chelsea. As was common practice,
if they suspected to find artefacts, Arthur or his partner were asked
to accompany the Aurors on their raid of the property. This meant a late
night watching doors being bashed in with bludgeoning hexes and countless
hours sorting through the brickabrack that someone stashed where they
had no business. Only a small portion was dark at all, and only a bit
of that was muggle in origin. A couple of biting tea sets and a rather
nasty book of limericks that were not only quite dirty, but the book was
enchanted to force the reader to sing each and every limerick loudly,
in a public place, before it could be removed from their hands.

By the time he arrived home, he had little more than a couple of hours
before his wife's normal time to greet the day. He shucked his robe with
considerable less care than his norm and climbed in to snuggle with his
Mollywobbles. It had been a long day, which would correspond with a very
short night's rest afterwards

* * *

Come Saturday morning, Ginny found the twins up well before her, surely
in anticipation for their first school shopping trip. Amazingly enough,
their mum's promise still stood to allow them to go to Gambol & Japes
for their joking needs. For as much as Molly Weasley complained about
her son's concentration and dedication to the pranking pass-time, she
also never seemed to refuse them their supplies for long. Occasionally
they would step over some line and she would take the tricks away for
a while, but if they stayed within boundaries, she would leave them be.

The plans for the day were a fiasco in the waiting, as both of her parents
had planned on taking the whole family to the alley en masse. All nine
Weasley's through the floo at the Leaky Cauldron for one trip. Even
Bill had been recruited on this, his day off, to help supervise all of
the young children. Ginny might have taken offence, but she loved being
around Bill and really didn't think of the number of minders her parents
were planning.

Unbeknownst to Ginny or most of her brothers was that her father's
part of the trip was not solely meant to mind the children. Molly had
asked him to speak with the goblins to see if he could ascertain the
rightful place for the extra sickles and knuts in their vault. Like most
traditional wizarding families, the Weasleys were still split greatly
along traditional lines; Arthur provided for his family through his
career, while Molly reared the children and cared for the family. As
traditional, the father of the family was in overall charge of the money,
although the mother bought everything needed to keep the family running
and well fed. To them it was natural. Once Molly had found the discrepancy
in their finances, Arthur was tapped to investigate the source, or at
least the validity of the extra money. He'd share what he found, and
she trusted him to sort it all out.

Much to Ginny's disappointment, Harry had to stay at home. She
understood why, and agreed, but that didn't make her any happier with
the necessity. She plodded from store to store at her mother's side,
not feeling as adventurous, running a ruckus through the alley from
store to store, as she would have if she had been her normal happy self.

"Hey, Gred," George said to his twin. They were in the book shop with
the rest of their family, hidden from their mother's view where they
could look at books she might not completely approve of.

"Yes, Forge?"

"Have you noticed anything ... wrong with our sister the youngest?"

"Now that you mention it, yes, our sister the youngest is not her normal
bouncy self."

"I agree. The rose seems to have left her cheeks, indeed."

"It is more like a sister the oldest."

"Although she is that as well."

"Ah, but we always preferred to think of her as sister the youngest."

"Of course, with Percy to deal with, we don't need a sister the oldest."

"Agreed. Do you have a solution for the melancholy of our sister the
youngest?"

"Without knowing the ailment, a cure will be most elusive."

"Perhaps, if a cure will not be attainable, a treatment could be found."

"And what, my dear brother, is the best treatment for melancholy?"

"This we have always known."

"Then a treatment shall be administered immediately."

"Perhaps our visit to Gambol will aid us in this."

"Do not forget the genius in Japes, my dear fellow."

"Of course not. Silent though he was, he provided laughter from the
shadows."

"As any true entertainment genius would."

"Shall we?"

"Of course. She deserves no less."

Had anyone seen them coming, they may have had the sense to be
frightened. However, before anyone knew it, the twins had scooped the
young girl from her mother's side and plopped her down at a small reading
table across from the counter. Immediately, George went back to their
mother while Fred talked to Ginny.

"Mum, we're going to take Ginny for some ice cream. She doesn't seem to
be having any fun, and we think she could use some."

"I don't know, George. I don't know if it's safe for the three of you
to be running around alone. You two are just eleven, after all."

"We're just going down the alley to Florean Fortescue's and then to
Gambol and Japes. We'll be fine. You can find us in the joke store when
Percy and Charlie finish with their browsing."

"And your books, dear?"

"On the counter, mum."

"Did you get a set for each of you?" she asked. "I won't have you falling
behind on your school work because you don't both have your own books."

"It doesn't seem necessary. We'll be in all of the same classes, but
yes we did. It's all there on the counter."

"Very well. Keep your sister safe. Here's two galleons for the ice
cream," she said as she retrieved two of the few gold coins in her money
sack. "Buy your sister something fun but harmless at the joke shop,
will you? Remember ... harmless ."

"Yes, mum. We will."

Meanwhile, back at the table ...

"What's going on?" Ginny asked suspiciously.

"Well, little sister," Fred said. "We noticed that you seem down. That
you weren't really into this shopping trip. And, while we understand
that you don't get to buy your school supplies for a little bit yet,
plodding along at your mother's side with a melancholy expression is
not the way a lively girl such as yourself should be acting. At the very
least Mum should have had to yell after you as you ran off to one thing
or another. Yet, you are just moping along."

"I'm not down and I'm not moping," Ginny insisted vehemently. "Harry
should just be..." By the time she realized that she had said the name
of her husband, mind, the husband that her family didn't know about in
the slightest, his name had already slipped her lips. Instantly she was
stricken, her secret revealed, she was sure.

"What was that?" Fred asked with a dangerous smile. "That wouldn't be
Harry as in the famous Harry Potter, would it?"

Ginny was trapped. She was struck dumb trying to find the words to defuse
the mistake she had made and convince her brother that she had not just
revealed something so secret. While Fred moved on in his musings, Ginny
was mute in horror.

"And here I thought that mum and dad didn't poison your mind with the
stories of the famous slayer of dark lords," Fred teased. "But it seems
that their precious little girl fell in love with The Boy Who Lived
nonetheless. What ever are we to do?"

"Fred, please," Ginny pleaded. "Don't say anything."

"What? That my little sister is in love with an icon of the modern
wizarding world?" Fred asked. "You know ... I think there was some shots
of little Harry some time ago in the Prophet. Seems someone saw him out
amongst the muggles. You don't suppose that I could find a copy of that
for you, some decoration for your walls, or some such?"

"No, you don't understand..." Ginny started but was interrupted when they
were joined by her other current keeper and proposed entertainer, George.

"What is this over here, Gred? I trust you to make our sister happy,
and she seems to be horrified at the thought. What in the world did you
do? You didn't tell her that knock-knock joke. I told you not to tell
that one to the kiddies."

"Not that," Fred said. "It seems that little Ginny here is depressed that
her love, Harry Potter, could not join us on this little outing. I offered
to find a copy of the Prophet from a year or two ago that had his picture,
you know, for her walls, but she doesn't seem to be warming to the idea."

"Yes, I seem to recall that issue. Mum was looking at the photos,
worrying that he was being cared for properly. So she has found the one,
and it is he?"

"So it would seem, Forge."

"I seem to recall that, not so long ago, there were some more pictures of
our sister's beau. Seems that he was here in Magical London, wondering
around Diagon Alley. He was the right age, too. Just a year older than
our little faery. Perhaps there is something there, Gred my brother?"

"Perhaps there is, Forge," Fred agreed. They both turned to the still
horror stricken Ginny with smiles. "Would little Ginny like for us to
find this potential suitor and show him the light that is our sister. Make
sure he falls in love with you in return?"

Suddenly, Ginny realized that she hadn't revealed as much as her
panic thought. She said his name and conveyed her wish that he could
be shopping with them, but she hadn't mentioned her relation to him,
or his current whereabouts. The relief flooded her nerves, opening the
way for her to enjoy what her brother's were doing to improve her mood,
now that she could see that that's what they wanted to do for her.

"You know," George said. "Harry Potter should be in the same year as
Ronnikins, a full year before our sister. Perhaps we can work our magic
when the time comes and sway the young lord to our sister's charms,
if that is what she has her heart set upon."

"It would only be our duty, as good brothers, to offer such aid," Fred
agreed. "That is, once we have made sure that he is at least good enough
to be in the presence of our heavenly sister."

This worried her a bit. Her brothers would want to know if Harry was
good enough for her, just like her grandmum had. She knew she couldn't
count on the fact that her grandmum had approved being an indicator of
the rest of the family. The dice would fall how they will.

"Of course. Wouldn't want any rabble around, would we?"

"Hey, guys, don't I get a say in my own future? You practically have
him trussed up and at an altar already."

"But, of course, our dearest Ginny. We will be sure to ask you before
you take your vows."

"In fact, I think that's one of the things the minister asks when he is
performing a marriage ceremony. What is it..."

"'Do you, Ginevra Molly Weasley, take this man, Harry James Potter,
to be your wedded husband, bound magically from heart to heart, till
death do you part?'"

"Yes," Ginny agreed immediately. "They do ask you, but I'm talking before
he's kidnapped and tied to an altar in dad's old dress robes."

For a moment after the traditional words were offered and she accepted,
she was wistful, hoping that, someday she could agree to the words and
complete the ceremony in front of all of those that cared about her,
as she once again accepted a bond to Harry Potter.

"Of course we would, Ginny."

"We would never embark on such a high risk mission without making sure
you would put the prize to proper use."

"It would only be what's right."

"Come along," George bade them. "Mum gave us some gold to entertain our
little sis, and it would be against some code to not take full advantage
of such generosity immediately."

"What say you to an adventure by way of Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream
Parlour with an eventual destination of Gambol and Japes?"

The twins loose in the joke shop was something not to be missed,
especially without their mum there to tell them 'no'. Ginny would be
glad to go along for the fun.

"A man of pure genius," George replied. "Great minds think alike."

"More likely," Ginny sniped with a smile, "one brain, even in two bodies,
can still only come up with one thought."

"Oh, she doth wound us, Fred."

"Yes, a sister after our own hearts."

Amid Ginny's giggles, her twin brothers dragged her from the book store,
towards one of the most liked stores on the alley, by adult and child
alike; Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.

The answers Arthur was receiving at the bank were informative at the
same time they were more perplexing than the original questions. So far,
the goblins' nature to not put their noses into the private business of
others, at least as they would talk to others about, had given him plenty
of brick walls to run into. He asked his questions, but the answers were
not helpful.

"Can you tell me why the trust that controls the land my house is on
has seen fit to return a hundred galleons to my account? We have been
paying the appropriate sum for that land for many years and this is the
first time that anything has changed. Can you tell me anything about why?"

"I'm sorry, sir. I can only tell you what the transaction record has
recorded, and, as you can see, we have never recorded the why's of
the galleon transfers. Wizard's thought processes matter little to
goblins. What does matter is that we follow the transfer instructions."

"If you're sure..."

"I can assure you, without a doubt, Mr. Weasley, that the money was
rightfully transferred into your vault, and is indeed your money to
spend as you see fit. I would not worry about what others thought when
they made such a transfer. Perhaps they will see fit to inform you by
post as to the change in your agreement."

"Maybe you're right. Either way, there isn't anything more I can learn
today."

"Of course. Anything else, or can I get back to the other patrons?"

Arthur thought about it and remembered that the school had requested
another transfer, the one that had started this whole mess of
investigation into the origin of extra coins in the Weasley Family
vault. Though his wife had guessed the amount of their mysterious windfall
to be the needed seventy galleons, he had found it to be greater, a
round hundred galleons, according to the register of goblin transfers
involving his vault. All he had been able to learn, even after more
than once asking his questions, was that the money was in his account
on purpose, and was rightfully there as far as the goblins of Gringotts
Bank were concerned. For now it would have to be good enough for him as
well. He had still to pay for his second son's specialized education.

"Can you initiate another transfer for me at this time, seventy galleons
to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?" Arthur asked. "And I
would like a receipt in the name of Charlie Weasley sent to the Deputy
Headmistress of Hogwarts with a note of 'NEWT Care of Magical Creatures
Travel Expenses'."

When Ginny had to decide what to order at the parlour, it was all a bit
overwhelming. Her parents had taken the family there in the past, but it
was always with the question of what flavour they wanted their two scoops
in, and now her brothers were insisting that she get something a bit more
complicated. They, in fact, insisted on toppings and nuts and sprinkles,
oh, and a cherry on top. They wanted to insist on adding something that
would explode with each bite, or at least pop on the plate, but Ginny
was quite certain that anything like that on her ice cream would just
not be right. In the end, they had fun with family unity and ordered
a single giant banana split with three bananas and six cherries. After
the first bite, any negative emotion that she may or may not have been
displaying earlier was washed away on a wave of joy and sugar.

The trip to Gambols and Japes was a rip roaring success. They had showed
her the rubber chickens that could run after people and bash them over
the head when they least expected it without a person to wield them
at all. They showed her the dung bombs in all their variety, of which
at least five packs were vitally necessary for the twins to purchase,
at least according to their view of the world. Various colour changing
potions and delayed reaction powders made their way into the twins'
inventory, sure to be the terror of all coming Hogwarts students to
one degree or another. Ginny selected something that wouldn't cause
any harm, just as her mother had requested of George. Luckily neither
twin saw the specific colour of the hair colouring potion she selected,
as she didn't have a credible excuse why she wanted a red that would
be much the Weasley red, and so couldn't be used on the family. No one
would notice if she did, after all.

Just at the doors to the joke shop is where the whole family reunited
from three fronts. Molly was leading Charlie, Ron and Percy from the
direction of the quill shop and Arthur was coming fresh from the bank,
as they met their twins and daughter just outside the bustling shop.

Husband and Wife locked eyes for long enough to get through the questions
that the children needn't know about. A small nod from Arthur let Molly
know the money that mysteriously reached their vaults was legitimate and
a small ease of her shoulders and the ghost of a relieved smile told him
all he needed to know, that she was happy that it had been sorted and
was theirs. The specifics, what little there were, would come later in
private. Had there been any trouble with the kids, Molly would have let
her husband know with a look and a scowl, but there had been nothing. The
twins, in fact, had earned some points by looking out for their sister
so well. Molly could see the bright smile on her daughter's face quite
well, as could anyone in the alley that day.

"So, have we got everything we need?" Arthur
asked. "Robes? Wands? Books? Cauldrons? Batteries?"

Ginny giggled, "Silly daddy! They don't need batteries at Hogwarts. They
wouldn't even work!"

"Oh, yes," he said, hamming it up a bit. "My mistake. Never can have
enough batteries, though, I say. Ingenious though they are, they don't
last forever."

"Got everything just fine, Arthur. Come along, kids. Time to floo home."

* * *

Molly, Arthur and the kids returned home safely and to a cacophony as
all of the kids took their purchases to their rooms for storage until
school, or whenever they'd need them.

Molly went immediately to the kitchen to get dinner sorted. What she
found was a clean kitchen, as always, but there was just something
a little off about it. It felt, to her, like it had been disturbed,
somehow, just a little bit. Like everything was just a little out of
place. Not that anything seemed to have moved, but just that.... She
didn't know what, but it was just off.

She decided that the long day herding children at Diagon Alley had just
played with her senses and she must be imagining things. With a few
flicks of her wand and a bit of direction, vegetables were chopping on
the block, butter was melting in a pot and potatoes were shedding their
skins like snakes. She busied her hands with preparing the piece of beef
that was on the menu for the night's supper. It was easy to forget all
else when she was busy preparing dinner for her family.
