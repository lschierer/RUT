## Family Inseparable

### Chapter 9

By: Musings of Apathy  
Edited by Luke Schierer

* * *

Molly Weasley walked calmly through the wood behind her house, a very
small basket hanging from her hand. She knew her daughter was within,
somewhere along the trail she travelled; she had, after all, seen Ginny
enter this particular path. A simple spell, common for mothers, kept
her following the right path, even as it forked. She wasn't worried
about reaching her destination with any speed or stealth. Her children
knew she checked up on them on occasion, and she trusted and respected
them enough to not pounce on them from the bushes. She would, after all,
know if they had done anything wrong. A traditional mother's little helper
spell let her know each time her little darlings hurt themselves. Really,
she didn't worry, but it was still her duty to check on her children. At
least she could keep up appearances, with a few small snacks and a letter
from Charlie in the basket for her daughter.

* * *

"Now, what is it that has you so concerned, Arabella?" Albus said calmly,
despite what had brought him to his office. He stood behind his desk,
ready to sit in his chair, and motioned an offer for the elderly woman
to sit in one of the guest chairs facing. "I would offer you tea, but
what you have to say seems urgent."

"It is, Headmaster," Mrs. Figg said in a panicked, rushed tone. She
ignored his offer of a chair , pacing back and forth, worrying the handle
of her purse. "Harry's gone."

"Harry Potter isn't at the Dursley residence?" the Headmaster asked. He
came from behind his desk to lean on the far side. If his guest would
not be sitting, he shouldn't either. He looked to the silver spinning
and puffing gadgets that dotted his shelves and saw nothing different
than he had seen before. "I was sure he was alright. My instruments you
see ... Perhaps you should tell me everything."

"Well, I returned from Cynthia's yesterday afternoon," she told him. "I'm
so sorry, Professor. I thought it would be alright to wait until today
to go check on him. I brought my shopping list. Thought I'd ask Petunia
to have young Harry assist me at the market. I played up the dottering
old woman a bit to make sure, but when I got there she said Harry wasn't
available to help. I asked if I could come back later when he wasn't
busy, but she said he wasn't gardening in the back, but that he had done
a runner. He left in the middle of the night near two months ago. What
are we to do? He could be in danger."

"Are you completely certain?" Dumbledore asked. "My instruments don't
indicate the approach of any wizards and that he feels safer and happier
now than in the past."

"Well, there you go, Professor," Mrs. Figg said conclusively. "That
proves he isn't at the Dursleys. He's never been exactly happy with his
relatives. If he's happy and he feels safe, he can't be within reach
of any of those people; his Uncle, his Aunt or his cousin. None of the
three would stand for his happiness."

"That is indeed unfortunate, if what you say is true. But,
perhaps the instruments are mistaken in his level of happiness," he
reasoned. "Perhaps he was simply unavailable due to a punishment for
some boyish misbehaving. After all, he is just nine. Who knows what all
he could have done that would warrant him being restricted to his room."

"But why would Petunia tell me he had left?" Mrs. Figg asked.

"Merlin only knows," the Headmaster sighed. "Perhaps she thought he
would have had too much of a good time during his punishment if she had
allowed him to go along with. Who knows how the woman thinks. Your role
may have been discovered."

"I doubt that, Professor," she replied. "I haven't ever seen Harry
any more than slightly relieved to be at my house in all of the times
I have sat for him. He doesn't seem to have a love for cats, at least
not mine. I believe he has really done a runner. I think he's gone."

"That is most distressing," Dumbledore fretted. "Most distressing,
indeed."

Disturbed by the news that the young boy was missing, as he was becoming
convinced as well, a confused Headmaster allowed the elderly Mrs. Figg
to go back through the floo. She asked that he come along as soon as he
could. She would be checking with the neighbours, finding out what she
could about the boy wizard's disappearance.

Before the green flame died down in the quieted office, Professor
Dumbledore was out through the door proper, negotiating the
spiralling stairs as quick as his long robes would allow. With the vast
responsibility he carried, he couldn't just up and leave, at least not
without notifying his deputy.

* * *

Molly's walk through the wood was beginning to make her worry. She hadn't
come across her daughter yet, even with the use of her mum's tracking
spell. The spell still insisted she go further into the woods along the
same path she was travelling With seven children, she learned long ago
which spells she could trust to not lead her astray, and this was one
of the better. Finally with her wand pointing her to a small clearing,
Molly found her daughter.

"Ginny, what are you up to?" Molly called into the clearing.

* * *

Professor Dumbledore was through Mrs. Figg's floo in Little Whinging
before the end of ten minutes. He had to be proud of his decision those
years ago to appoint Minerva McGonagall his deputy. The witch was the best
he had ever met, able to understand and adapt to whichever new situation
she was faced with in moments. She hardly even had to be told he was going
to Little Whinging to check on the Dursleys before she assured him she
would keep the school well in control while he investigated Mr. Potter's
disappearance. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he waited with dread
for the stern woman to remind him of her opinion those nearly eight years
ago. He couldn't dwell on that thought, however. She would remind him,
he was sure, if for no other reason than to keep him humble. In their
friendship, it seemed his deputy had taken on the role of keeping him
from completely believing his own press.

His only pause before finally stepping through the floo was to transfigure
his clothing to that of a well dressed muggle and do a switching spell
to move his beard to a bust amongst the rest of his baubles. He rarely
visited muggles, some trips to muggle shops on occasion, but it was
enough to understand what would be acceptable attire. No fool, he knew
his robes were garish even for the eccentric wizarding society.

Albus Dumbledore stepped from the floo at Mrs. Figg's house, on Magnolia
Crescent, with nary a spot of soot on his dark suit, a skill he had not
mastered until his age reached the triple digits. Working with Nicholas
Flamel had left him much to aspire to, still. The oldest man on Earth,
by all reliable accounts, performed such control of magic as to make it
seem natural.

* * *

Ginny and Harry had just finished their ceremony and had separated when
Ginny's mum calmly walked into the clearing. They both immediately froze
in shock. There was no way around it, they were discovered. The only
saving grace that prevented her mum from entering the clearing full of
rage, was that the ceremony they had just completed, the first with the
new altar, had no words or other sounds. This ceremony was all intent as
they looked deeply in each other's eyes and connected with their left
hands and wand tips. That Ginny was still grasping a smooth, red wand,
and Harry still had a natural, crooked wand, just made the entire scene
all that more incriminating, they knew.

* * *

Petunia Dursley had had a bad feeling about this day from when she
woke up. She refused to think that she would have anything so strange
as intuition, much less anything like her sister had talked about;
seeing the future indeed. No, she had none of that freakishness in her,
nor would she ever.

Her feelings had not settled in the least when the old woman from around
the corner who was normally willing to watch over the brat, good riddance,
showed up at her door, asking about the whelp. Carry her groceries, she
wanted. And then, when she was told Harry wasn't there anymore, she had
the gall to suggest her precious Duddikins help her out, like the freak
had done before. Well, Petunia would have none of that. Her precious had
better things to do than help some pensioner to the store. This was his
time to rest from school, the weekends. She wouldn't have her son taxed
by such menial tasks. Her solid boy was destined for greater things,
just like his father.

A knock at the door startled her, just as it had earlier when the old
crone had come around. She looked through the peep to see an old man, well
dressed, but with indecently long hair. Why a man who would attire himself
in a well crafted suit would show such a deficit in character with such
obscene hair was beyond her. Reluctantly, she opened the door half way.

"Hello, Petunia," the old man greeted her as soon as her face
appeared. "How are you today?"

"Do I know you?" the housewife asked.

"Can't say we have met in a rather long time, but I believe we do know
each other."

"Who ...?"

"Perhaps if you would permit me to come in, we could conduct our business
in the privacy of your home?" he asked, looking directly in her eyes.

The woman looked left and right cautiously, as if to see twenty neighbours
peeping from every fence and hedge. With a slightly frightened nod,
she gestured him into her home.

"Now, who are you and what do you want?" she asked him after the
necessities had been completed.

"I am Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. I was a friend of
your sister and her husband. I believe you know of me, if not know
me altogether."

"You're one of them. You're one of those freaks. You're the one who put
that abomination with us, forced us to take him."

"This is most distressing. Where is Harry Potter?" the Headmaster asked,
getting angry and upset.

"I don't have to tell you anything. Get out of my house!" she screamed
shrilly at the wizard.

"Now, Petunia," the aged man said as he slowly pulled his wand from
seemingly nowhere. "I am sure we can be reasonable about this."

The woman visibly shrank back from the angered wizard upon seeing his
instrument, his weapon. "He's gone. He just up and disappeared one night
a couple of months ago. That's all I can tell you."

"But where did he go? How did he leave? Why did he leave? Did someone
take him? There are still so many questions that need answering."

"But I don't know anything else," Petunia assured him. "He just vanished
one night without so much as a 'by your leave'. His door was locked and
the house was locked. I don't know where he went. Must have been one of
those damned freak things. I don't know anything else."

"This is most unfortunate," Dumbledore said with regret. His wand
came up to point the woman in between the eyes. "I am very sorry,
Petunia. Legilimens."

* * *

"Ginny, there you are, darling. What have you been doing?"

Ginny was near panicking inside her mind. She had been caught with her
husband performing yet another wedding ceremony. She was still riding
the high the bonding produced, the very same reason Ginny and Harry
kept exploring new ways to expand their bond, was making it hard to
be too sad or frightened about anything at the moment. Her years as
the youngest of seven kicked in, allowing her to tell the greatest,
and most repeated lie to her mum's question.

"Nothing, mum." A lie, just like every time a child says they are doing
nothing.

"Well, you sure went to a lot of effort for nothing. When I was a little
girl, I remember playing at marriage several times, although I usually
married one of my little dollies."

Confused, Ginny said, "I'm sorry, mummy. I'm sorry I didn't marry one
of my dollies."

Molly chuckled at her daughter's misunderstanding. "No, that's not what I
meant. I just meant that I usually did it in my own house with a dolly,
rather than a tree stump, an attractive one to be sure, but certainly
different than a dolly."

"A tree stump?" Ginny asked, looking between Harry, who was frozen,
petrified in fright, and her mum.

"Oh, I'm sorry. I've forgotten what it was like to pretend. A mighty fine
husband you've found there, dear. I hope he'll take proper care of you."

Ginny was getting more and more confused. She could see Harry standing
still on the far side of the altar, just as he had when her mum entered
the clearing. Why, her mum's teasing made no sense. "Um, sure he does."

"Okay, dear. I can see you're well taken care of. I'm off to see to
the roast. I brought you a little snack basket to tide you over until
dinner and a letter from your brother Charlie. If you can pry yourself
from your honeymoon, please join us. Don't forget you should answer your
brother's letter."

"O-kay," Ginny answered now supremely confused, the basket of goodies
hanging from her hand. She knew her mum was teasing her, but she didn't
know exactly what just happened. Before she could contemplate it further,
her mum was off back to the trail leading to the family home.

* * *

The series of events Dumbledore saw through his mind magic just confirmed
what the Headmaster had been told from both Mrs. Figg, and strangely the
woman before him, Mrs. Dursley. Harry had disappeared over the course of
one night more than two months previous. No trace had been shown since
the woman's blood nephew disappeared, not that the woman had looked
in the slightest. Apparently the only changes in her routine the boy's
disappearance necessitated was falsifying evidence of the boy's housing
arrangements before calling the authorities, and shifting her schedule
to make sure all of the chores were completed.

The Headmaster, of course, found the treatment the Dursleys poured on
their nephew to be appalling. There was no doubt the couple found no
love for their charge, but not even a man so experienced around children
could have expected them to treat family so shoddily. He was equally sure
their treatment of their own son was doing the boy no favours. Already
Dudley Dursley was showing signs he would not be prepared for life as an
adult, even ten years hence. He had enough experience as an educator to
see the truth behind Petunia's overwhelming sense of pride in her son,
that the boy would not make it through school with any sort of honours,
at least as far as educational goals could be counted.

"I see," Dumbledore said after reviewing the woman's memories, which
left her a bit cloudy in mind. "Petunia... Mrs. Dursley!"

With his shout, she came out of her mind magic induced stupor. "What is
it you want? You can see he isn't here any longer. Your business here
is done. You may leave post haste."

"Mrs. Dursley, you were given the simple task of taking in your sister's
only son, an orphan, into your home and seeing to his care and growth. You
seem to have failed in that. What do you have to say for yourself?"

"We, neither my husband nor myself, were asked if we even wanted the brat
in our home. What right do you have to put him here without asking?"

"Madame, in my day, when a family was in need, help was provided no
matter the rivalry between sisters, brothers or cousins. Can you not
see your responsibility in this?"

"We provided the boy with clothes on his back, food in his belly and a
good sense of his place in the world. We were responsible for nothing
more."

"The only thing that should limit young Harry's place in the world is his
own desire and hard work. With his family's standing, he could be anything
from a humble cobbler to the leader of this land, whatever he chose."

"I shudder to picture a freak in such an important position. Leader
indeed. I suppose he might lead your group of freaks, but who would
care? Long as him and those like him stay away from the good, upstanding
people that lead this great nation, the normal ones of us in this nation,
I could care less who your kind picks to tell them what to do."

* * *

"What in the world just happened?" Ginny asked her husband after her mum
was out of earshot. She was very confused about what could have caused
her mum to act so strange.

"You don't suppose she really did just see me as a tree stump, do
you?" Harry asked.

"I don't see how," Ginny said. "You were right there."

"Maybe, with the necklace messing with how she noticed me," Harry
reasoned, "and with this wand looking like a little branch, maybe the
magic or something made her think I was a stump."

"That's just..." she said, screwing her face up to wrap her mind around
the strange happenings and theories. "I don't think I'll ever understand
magic. It doesn't seem it'll ever be simple."

"I don't think it's supposed to be simple or understood. If it was,
it wouldn't be magic."

* * *

"I'll have you know that there have been several ministers and dignitaries
throughout the history of Britain who possessed a great amount of skill
in the magical arts," Dumbledore educated her. "As history has it, they
were quite accomplished in their roles in government, as well. It has
only been in the last couple of centuries that the separation between
our worlds has become more pronounced."

"I don't know what you're on about, but if we're separate from you
freaks," Petunia spat, "I'll be that much happier. I think it time you
left. There is nothing more for you here."

"There is still the question of the disposition of young Harry if he is
found," Dumbledore soldiered on.

"Do with him what you will," she instructed him, "he left this house of
his own choosing and as far as I am concerned, he can stay gone."

"You are his only living relative," he reminded her. "Neither his father's
family, nor you own, was ever a large one, and the recent times have
hit both hard, although a long life was never a Potter trait. They have
greatly tended to make their impression on the world grand and early in
life. Thus, you are the only one left to care for him."

"I told you before," she argued, "he is not wanted here."

"Perhaps if I were to address some of your concerns," the Headmaster
bargained, "we could come to an arrangement that would provide for his
satisfactory care. Maybe a discussion over a cup of tea?"

* * *

"Do you suppose the necklace would work that well on the others?" Harry
asked, chomping into a carrot.

Ginny contemplated the thought. "I don't know, but we can't risk it." She
liked the cheese and crackers her mother included. The cheese was a good
sort, with a bit of a tooth to its flavour

"I know, you're right," Harry agreed. They lapsed into a comfortable
silence. "Did you like that ceremony?"

Ginny smiled at him beautifully. "Very much. It was weird with my mum
there while I could still feel the magic, but it was very nice."

"I'm glad. I enjoyed it too. I was just too frozen when your mum came to
hug or kiss you like normal. I hope you weren't too disappointed by that."

"It would have been great, but I know neither of us could help it,"
Ginny said. "Besides, you'll hold me tonight, and that's good too."

Harry let that go without response.

"Shall we read the letter from Charlie?" Ginny asked.

"It's your letter, Ginny. I'd love to hear what he had to say, though."

Ginny unfolded the parchment after breaking the wax seal. Like most
children, she didn't know to appreciate her mum for all that she was and
all the trust she gave. The fact that the wax was still sealed didn't
register as having an alternative, one where her parents might have not
trusted her and would open and read her mail before she could. One day,
she might learn that not all parents were as good as hers, but hopefully
it would be many years before that life's little reality reared its
ugly head.

"Dear Ginny," she read.

> We are bound for our first trip to a preserve this coming weekend. Our
professor tells us the first will be a trip to Egypt's Nile river delta
where there is a colony of Sphinxes. This is a real treat. Sphinxes
are very intelligent, more intelligent than I will ever be I am afraid,
and were gracious enough to allow our class to visit. For the last two
weeks we have been studying their practices and cultures. It appears they
work with the wizarding world to protect their colonies, as their magical
abilities are not the sort that would protect and hide them from muggles,
which has led to the cooperative nature of their agreement. Wizards called
Rangers are employed to work with the sphinxes and to maintain wards
around their colony that have managed to keep the local muggles in the
dark as to the continued existence of the noble magical creatures. Did
you know that the sphinx was so revered by the ancient Egyptians that
they built a tomb for a respected sphinx advisor to Pharaoh Khafra around
4500 years ago? The monument still is around to this day. According to
wizarding history, the muggles have never unearthed the burial chamber,
even though the magics protecting it have never been renewed. Can you
imagine if the muggles came across that mummy?  
> 
> But, the reason I am writing to you is somewhat confusing. I checked my
supplies for the upcoming trip, and found the money sack you gave me. I
admit, when you said you had been saving your allowance, I pictured a nice
collection of knuts and sickles. What I found, though, was a bag full of
gold, as I'm sure you know. You didn't do anything silly like dip into
some sort of dowry savings mum and dad set aside, did you? I don't want
to take any money that will affect your future, Firefly. If the gold
was from a dowry sum, you will need that money when you've attracted a
great wizard. You know tradition as well as I. If the money wasn't from
that, where did you get it? I can't imagine any of our brothers having
such an amount, either in Gringotts or in a stash around the house,
not that I would dream in a thousand years you would take from one of
our brothers. I would never think you had stolen for this money.  
> 
> Please, I haven't said anything to mum and dad, but you have to
tell me where you got the money. We are Weasleys and we are proud and
upstanding. I await your owl. I leave by portkey before sunrise Saturday,
so make your answer fast.  
> 
> Love,
> 
> Charlie

Ginny set the letter down on the grass they were both kneeling in. Both
her and Harry were shocked and a little scared. They had been concealing
him for so long, they were a bit panicked at being found out. They felt
a tightness in their chests and their hearts clenched.

"This is not good," Harry said. "What are we going to do? I don't know
what we can do."

"I don't know either, Harry," Ginny said. "We have to come up with a
way to make Charlie happy. We can't tell him that the money was yours,
though. That would just bring too much up."

"It's your money too, Ginny," Harry insisted. "We'll have to think
of something."

"I know," Ginny said. She lapsed into silent thought for a moment. Harry
could tell that, whatever she was thinking, it wasn't easy for her. "I
can't lie to him. I can't lie to my brother."

"I'm sure we won't have to," Harry assured her. "We'll tell him the
whole truth if we have to."

Harry pulled Ginny in and held her tight. Neither had the age or wisdom
to realize that the deception they were perpetrating, even if not an
outright lie, was what was causing their grief. If they were lucky,
they would learn their lesson while they were still children, and not
perpetrate lies in the future. But, for them, at that moment, they didn't
yet know how much simpler and happier life could be without having to
hold a deception.

* * *

Professor Dumbledore arrived at Gringotts after coming to a satisfactory
understanding with Petunia Dursley. The woman wouldn't be convinced to
act in the best interest of her nephew for altruistic motivations, but
there were other incentives for her to act as a good aunt should. And,
perhaps, if her son was provided with a good education at university
once he was grown, the world would be a better place. He could think of
no greater good.

"May I speak with the head of accounts, please," Professor Dumbledore
asked of the teller once he was able to reach the front of the queue. The
goblins unsettled the old professor quite too easily. His experiences
with them proved they were not to be tangled with. They held little
respect for wizards or their accomplishments. The magic wielded by a
goblin accomplished all of the things important to a goblin, and little
else would registered to them as of consideration.

"If he will see you, you may. Wait over there," the teller said with a
sharp pointed finger. The teller made another entry into his leather bound
ledger, ignoring any other actions from the Headmaster. He, regally,
went to where the teller indicated. Before long, not even a quarter
hour, he was ushered through the lobby to more administrative parts of
the bank. He had too many interactions with the bank to be surprised,
but in all of his years he had never been able to detect a goblin's
magic. He hadn't seen the teller indicate to anyone what he needed,
but here he was, being ushered into an office labelled 'Head of Accounts'.

"What is it?" he was gruffly asked immediately upon entering the
office. The goblin never looked up from his ledger which he was constantly
making entries in, the purpose of which, Dumbledore had no idea.

"A young orphan has gone missing from his guardian's care," Dumbledore
answered. "I was hoping Gringotts could assist in locating the boy."

"Most unusual," the goblin growled. "This isn't something that would
normally involve Gringotts. After all, we are a bank, not a locator
service."

"I am merely looking for information," Dumbledore said. "It could all
total up to finding the boy safely."

"Ah, but information is a very prized and cherished commodity," the goblin
reasoned. "Gringotts has not risen to the trust it has with customers
by sharing its clients' information with other members of the public."

"But I am the Supreme Mugwump," Dumbledore argued. "Surely I have the
ability and duty to investigate a matter which involves the safety of
one of the wizarding world's under age citizenry?"

"Very well," the goblin grumbled unwillingly. "Who is the child who has
gone missing?"

"Harry James Potter," the Headmaster answered, "son of Lily and James
Potter."

"Let me see," the goblin said as he turned to the latter part of his
ledger. A few more thumbed pages and he was apparently where he wanted
to be, as he started reading, guiding his way down the page with the
feather tips of his quill. "So, that would mean you are inquiring about
activity on..."

"Harry Potter's trust vault, number 687," the Headmaster answered the
obvious prompt.

With another flip of the page, the goblin reviewed one more thing before
snapping the large book shut. "It seems there has been no activity from
that vault since its original deposit. It would seem he has not accessed
his trust account. Is there something else I can help you with?"

Professor Dumbledore hadn't expected to find the boy had run from his
muggle relatives and happened to find his parents' legacy in the wizarding
world's bank, but he had hoped. It was just the first of many leads he
had to investigate. A quick look at his watch, with the planets circling
the centre, showed him he was truly out of time this day for business
away from school grounds. Perhaps he could find some quiet assistance
in the future.

"No," he said as he rose from the chair. "I believe that is all you can
help me with. Thank you for your time."

The Headmaster walked down the hall, back to the lobby without a backwards
glance. Had he looked to where he had come, rather than doggedly to
where he was headed, he might have seen the goblin he was just dealing
with moving in the opposite direction with a smile on his face and a
bounce to his step that would have been rather startling from a goblin,
who are not known to be the most jovial of races.

* * *

Harry and Ginny managed to not let the gravity of Charlie's letter weigh
them down for the rest of the afternoon. They still managed to have
some fun, playing in the forest. They didn't perform any other marriage
ceremonies, but there was plenty of running and laughing. A child's mind
is wonderfully able to get on with what is important to them, namely play,
but Harry and Ginny were not to be completely distracted. They both knew
they still needed a solution, something to tell Charlie that would keep
their secret but not be a lie.

"Maybe we could just tell him," Harry said. "Do you think he would keep
our secret?"

Ginny worried her lower lip. She loved her brother, but she had learned
that brothers that much older had different ideas of what needed to be
told to their parents. Charlie was no tattle-tale, running off on every
little thing, but she knew he would tell her parents about anything
he thought they needed to know. She was afraid her being married and
her husband living in the house would be one thing he would think they
should know.

"No, I think he'd tell," Ginny answered. "He'd want them to know. He
wouldn't be like Grandmum. Least she was willing to keep our secret."

Harry's face lit up with an idea. "You don't suppose we could write to
your grandmum and ask her for help?"

Ginny thought about it for a moment. "I think you might be right. Maybe
she could help."

"Did you bring any parchment and ink?" Harry asked.

"No," Ginny answered. "We'll have to write her tonight after dinner."

"Okay," Harry said. He enveloped her in a hug and told her everything
would be alright.

* * *

Headmaster Dumbledore arrived back at Hogwarts just before the dinner
service was to start. He considered the timing to be quite fortuitous. He
could sit and pass word through the other teachers at the table to
gather after the students were dismissed for a staff meeting. Harry
being missing isn't something he wanted to go shouting to the Prophet
at this moment, but he would need more help than just Arabella Figg,
and he wasn't prepared to gather the old crowd just yet.

* * *

Harry and Ginny left the clearing for home well before the risk of
sunset. They knew her mum was joking when she all but gave permission
for her to stay out. Ginny knew everyone had to be at the dinner table
when the sun set, no later. Harry put his arm around her shoulder as
they walked back to the Burrow, his cloak and galaxy firmly in place
for protection. They still had thought of no real solution to Charlie's
curiosity, but they knew they needed to owl him within a few days or
trouble would just be starting.

They lapsed into silence for the remainder of the walk back. Behind
the broom shed, they shared a child-like kiss, their lips puckered in a
parody of an adult kiss. Perhaps in time they would learn how kisses are
meant to be shared between husband and wife. Perhaps when they grew older.
