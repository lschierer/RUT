###Works Cited
sortas="Works Cited"]]

Mrs. J. K. Rowling.  _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ American Digital
Edition first published in 2012.  The American edition was used even though I
prefer the British Additions because it is really difficult to get an electronic
copy of the British edition in the United States. 

fanfiction works that have been used as source material in whole or in part:

fanfiction works that have inspired this one, but are used less directly:

LullabyKnell. _[When in Doubt, Go to the Library](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12557131/1/When-in-Doubt-Go-to-the-Library)_
[Fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net) Last Viewed 2020-06-25.
This one was actually the inspiration for me thinking that Harry should get help
from Hogwarts itself. 

Areaderofstories. _[Harry Potter and the new beginnings](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23038633)_
[Archive Of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) last viewed 2020-06-12.  I'm
not sure why I included this, as it is a Harry/Draco story.
