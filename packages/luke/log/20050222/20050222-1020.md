Some news on the pro-life front today.<br  /><br  />

of Woman in Florida Lose Bid to Keep in Feeding Tube</a>" and "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1500/2-22-2005/20050222031502_17.html">Right-To-Die
Case Hinges on Appeals Court</a>" are talking about the Terri
Schiavo case down in Florida.  It appears that she is once again
about to have her feeding tube removed.  Pray for her and all
involved.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/22/international/americas/22bolivia.html?ei=5088&en=f41f4fefc1ec2d4f&ex=1266814800&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">Latin
America Fails to Deliver on Basic Needs</a>" talks about a move in
many Latin American countries to move back to public sector services
to try to provide clean water and such for the people the private
versions were failing to help.  I applaud these governments for
attempting to help their people, but given the record of failure
of governments world wide and in this area specifically to be able
to efficiently and effectively manage things, will this help?
