<p>Michelle Malkin reports on the conviction of some democrats in
what sounds like a very sizable corruption case.[1] I would tend
to bet that this sort of thing is far more common than is good
for us.  I am also positive that it <em>was</em> a politically
motivated investigation.  Republicans only investigate democrats,
and democrats only investigate republicans.  Both go more or less
party lines (as is amply demonstrated as the democrats forced
an investigation of Tom DeLay, which he widened into a general
investigation, which, surprise surprise, turned up democrats doing
the same thing (as well as other republicans)).  Along the same
lines, I have seen a friend of my father's imprisoned for much
less, for evidence my father maintained all along was fabricated.
If someone wants to find something, the higher up in government
you go, its either there to be found, or they will make it found.
Either you are dirty, or they are, such is politics.</p>
