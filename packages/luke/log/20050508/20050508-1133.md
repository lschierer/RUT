<p>A pair of students now have been found guilty of trespassing
because they were building a snow fort on grounds of the high school
they attend, on a snow day.[1]  The article makes it sound like the
police officer was throwing his weight around, being a bully,
and is getting away with it.  I doubt anyone now, except the two
kids and the police officer could really say for sure, both sound
possible to me.  I can see an officer getting upset at the lack
of respect from some of today's brats.  I can also see an officer
getting upset at having his authority legitimately challenged,
and deciding to throw the book at the kids.  Personally though,
these simply cannot be the brightest kids in the world, they could
so easily just have left and come back later.</p>
