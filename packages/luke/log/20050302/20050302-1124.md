<p> Michelle Malkin is incredibly critical of Newt Gingrich's "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64393-2005Mar1.html?sub=AR">Transform
It, Don't Reform It</a>" in her post, "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001632.htm">Gingrich's
Bold Medicaid Reform Proposal</a>."  However, I cannot entirely
agree.  Gingrich's proposal would substantially increase the
bureaucracy involved in Medicaid, tripling it.  But I think that
<em>if</em> we are to have a Medicaid, that the goals he outlines
are worthwhile.  I have faced some of the problems he outlines in
Medicaid's treatment of the elderly, he's right, it is anti-family.
And that isn't just.  He is also correct in pointing out that a
one sized fits all approach does not best serve the needs of the
elderly, the poor, and the disabled.  I'd still argue that the
Federal Government has no place in this sort of charitable work,
but, as I said, <em>if</em> we are stuck with having a Medicaid,
then his sounds at worst more humane than the present.</p>
