Mr. William Roper, the son-in-law of the the saintly man whose name makes up the title of this post, writes in a style very different from that we now use.<sup>[1]</sup>  When first I set to read his work, this fact proved a stumbling block.  Yet on again attempting, I find that having persisted by effort through two pages of it, the style begins to grow more comprehensible, and generate less of a challenge.
