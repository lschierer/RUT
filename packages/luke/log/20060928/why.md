oh why is there no support for the Areca raid controllers in the stock linux kernel yet?  They provide source code, they have packages for a number of different distributions (and often several versions of those distributions).  Support for it was in the -ac kernel back when there was a -ac kernel.  Why has it not been accepted?  It would make my life *so* much easier.
