<p>I read today of a little girl who does not age.  This seems, at
the surface, to be something that people would dream of, imagine not
getting old &#x2026; not getting older than six to twelve months.[1]
This little girl, now twelve <em>years</em> old, has no language
skills, but can crawl across a floor, or pull herself up in her crib.
Doctors have no clue what is wrong with her, and she has suffered
from all sorts of other things: "strokes, seizures, ulcers, severe
respiratory problems and a tumor the size of a lemon."  Pray for her,
and her family.</p>
