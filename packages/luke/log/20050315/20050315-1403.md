<p> While Florida legislators are working to
pass a bill to prevent hospitals from denying food
and water to those in a "vegetative" state, as per "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/03-15-2005/ffc1000c8b7d3c29.html">Fla.
Lawmakers Weigh Feeding Tube Bill</a>," David Limbaugh's "<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/recovered_veget.html">Recovered
"Vegetative State' Patient Kate Adamson Supports Terri</a>" reminds
us that if we give Him time, God does sometimes work miracles.
We cannot and should not ever give up on life.  An important lesson
for us all to ponder, especially when things seem to be going wrong
and badly.</p>
