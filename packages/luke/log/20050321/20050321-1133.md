<p> In further science news, I present to the reader "<a href="http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12660.html">Scientists
Discover What You Are Thinking</a>."  Some scientists think
they have figured out how to figure out the brain's signaling
for movement.  That wording is really bad, but I am not sure
how to word it better.  They have associated some of the brain's
signals, happening <em>just</em> before movement, to that movement.
Has the potential for helping develop robot arms, cybernetics,
and similar things.  Lots of good potential, some bad potential,
I think I end up falling more or less in favor of this research,
it is the application that is sketchy, not the method.</p>
