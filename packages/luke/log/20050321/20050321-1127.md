<p> A quick rundown of some of the news in the Terri
Schiavo case.  (Which is the correct spelling? I see
people spelling her first name both ways.)  David Limbaugh <a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/terry_schiavo_c.html">points
out</a> some resources and information that FindLaw has aggregated <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/lit/schiavo/index.html">here</a>.
The CSMonitor, a news source I picked up
at Nan's advice, has an article on the case <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0321/p01s03-uspo.html">here</a>.
Predictably, they are not too pleased with the Congress and
the president right now.  They do ask an interesting question,
how would I feel about this if Congress were interfering with
the State government on the other side of this mess?  I would
probably be pretty upset.  So perhaps the federal intervention
is not the best thing for us to have happening in the long
run, but it is nice to see the federal government doing
the right thing for once, even if I am unsure of their ends.
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4367201.stm">This</a>
is one of the fairest articles from the BBC that I have
seen since I started paying attention.  Usually the
BBC comes down fairly strong in its portrayal of this
as a "Right to Die" case.  Michelle Malkin weights in <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001812.htm">here</a>.
She has a quote from a Wall Street Journal
article, I kind of wish I had a Wall Street Journal
login to access the original.  She also links to "<a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2005/03/terri-nurses-perspective.html">Terri:
A Nurse's Perspective</a>."  I should ask Mollie about that, but I
most likely will not.  It does not stand to reason that starving
to death would be a "painless" way to die.  Going without food
for even a few days can be painful, I know that from my one insane
weight cut in high school.  I am sure that any of the children you
see in the advertisements for various charities with their stomachs
bloated from hunger would differ as well.</p>
