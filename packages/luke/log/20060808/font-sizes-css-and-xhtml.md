Apparently my use of "&lt;ol&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#x2026;" results in my page being invalid xhtml transitional.  I am not sure why I care; the browsers render what I want.  I do care however, so I am left in a bind.  I do not know much about CSS, certainly not enough to have done more than trivially edit the WordPress theme I am using.  From what I see in my search results, I am supposed to be using CSS to handle this sort of font sizing thing, and while I see something to that effect in the style.css for the theme, it appears to be wrapped up in how comments are treated.  I really do not know what I am doing, and advice and/or assistance would be welcome, including a pointer to a Fine Manual for me to Read (reference to RTFM).

On the off chance that anyone is willing to look at it, the style.css is up at <a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/style.txt">~luke/style.txt</a>.

<big>UPDATE 2006-08-08 22:34 EDT:</big> Vincas rocks.  He pointed me at <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/">http://alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/</a> and then continued to help me with examples and letting me think out loud until I figured out enough to add my own div id stuff.  So now I can make my references display small without violating xhmtl transitional.  &#x263a;
