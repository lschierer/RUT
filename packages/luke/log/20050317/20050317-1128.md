<p> Slow news day.  Nothing really caught my eye except an article
talking about Trusted Computing.  But it didn't have any new details,
just that Dell, HP and IBM are shipping hardware with it, and I
have known that for a while.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.endace.com">Endace</a>'s
software doesn't seem to work with RHEL4, and RHEL3u4, which they
do support, doesn't seem to detect the 3ware card we are using.
So I am installing debian, which does.  This reminds me how much I
wish that tasksel showed some of the "smaller" tasks, like gnome,
(desktop environment installs both gnome and kde).</p>
