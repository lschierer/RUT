<p>Mr. Pat Buchanan comes to the Church's defense today, defending
Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Pius XII against claims that Pope Pius
XII failed to assist the Jews during the Holocaust or was tactically
complicit in it.[1] He does so quoting, of all things, the New York
Times, hardly a fan of Catholicism.  He also quotes a number of
Jewish leaders from that era, all of whom uniformly praise Pope Pius
XII, and thank him for his efforts.  It is expected that the world
will hate the Church, and will distort her history and efforts.
That is why it is so important that we who are Catholic know and
learn the truth.</p>
