These wise words from almost a century ago[^211027-2] are brought to mind as I
read that the progressive view of history[^211027-3] is being challenged by
increasing amounts of evidence that our shift from a hunter/gatherer society to
an agricultural one was at best a mixed blessing.[^211027-4]  That statement is
at best itself an over simplification; while the article refutes certain common
ideas, it ignores others.  I *strongly* suspect that the real picture is,
naturally, very very complex. 

The main *factual* evidence is based on archaeological reconstructions of health
data.  Things like the average height of people over time (based on skeletons),
evidence of disease and malnutrition (also based on skeletons and teeth) are used
to construct rough mortality tables.  Based on this data, they estimate that the
shift to farming for communities near the Spoon and Illinois rivers changed the
average life expectancy at birth from twenty-six years to nineteen
years.[^211027-5]  Similarly, they estimate that the average height in Turkey
dropped from 5'9" for men and 5'5" for women to 5'3 for men and 5' for women,
something the article claims that they have still not fully recovered
from.[^211027-6]

The article also has some more speculative comparisons.  It looks at the average
diet of an African bushman to that of some of the surrounding agricultural
communities, and notes that the bushman has a better diet, and more leisure
time.  It looks at instances of inequality between the sexes in farming
communities like New Guinea, and references works of art by groups like the
Eskimos as further proof that [[!wikipedia Progressivism]] is false.  

I do not *really* doubt most of its premises.  Some of them are quite
interesting.  I do, as I said initially, think it is over simplifying and
ignoring some things.  While *art* may not have come from farming, the article
makes no mention of things like currency, writing, mathematics, or philosophy.
This is not to say that members of a hunter/gatherer tribe cannot be wise, but
rather that without writing, their wisdom will be lost within a few generations.
Sure, much can be passed on through oral histories and ballads, but not
everything.  Additionally, while the shift from a lifespan of twenty-six years
to nineteen years is a drastic example of backsliding, you really cannot argue
that twenty-six years is *good* for an average.  The infant and child mortality
to drive such a low number must have been heart crushing.  

If it is not that agriculture is universally better, it may be, as the article
suggests, that it enables more people.[^211027-7]  To make an analogy, it may be
healthier to live on a farm than in a city, but the city holds more people, and
at the end of the day, gets more done.  Which is better?  It depends on how you
measure.
