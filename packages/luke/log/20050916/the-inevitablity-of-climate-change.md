<p>Today I see a report talking about something I have speculated about several times now,<sup><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050907-1544/carbon-from-the-ground">[1]</a><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050615-1352/20050615-1352">[2]</a><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050425-1606/20050425-1606">[3]</a></sup> the idea that global warming, human caused or not, may not be reversible. That it might have reached the "point of no return."<sup><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article312997.ece">[4]</a></sup> His basis for this is that we are not seeing the arctic polar ice cap recovering from its annual summer melting, and that this melting is happening at (slowly) accelerating rates.  Logically, as there is less ice and more ocean exposed, the reduced albedo causes increased energy (heat) absorption, and thus more melting.</p>  <p>Undoubtedly this news will be met with more out cries for President Bush to agree to the Kyoto Accords, and to cut back on emission's.  Undoubtedly you will hear nothing suggesting that we might better be concerned with researching ways to reduce the human impact of this now inevitable change.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Mr. Luke Schierer.
