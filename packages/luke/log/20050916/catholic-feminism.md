<p>Mr. George Weigel asks</p>  <blockquote> There’s also food for thought here as Catholics of both sexes ponder the meaning of John Paul the Great’s Catholic feminism. The most beloved figure in contemporary Catholicism was a woman — Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta. The most powerful and successful Catholic media mogul of our time is a woman — Mother Angelica. What does it mean for the future that neither Mother Teresa no Mother Angelica had much use for “Catholic feminism” as it’s usually defined, and that both were completely devoted to John Paul II’s understanding of the unique dignity and vocation of women?<sup><a href="http://www.archden.org/dcr/news.php?e=148&s=3&a=3391">[1]</a></sup></blockquote>  <p>This is a good question to ask.  Perhaps someone can provide an answer.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Mr. George Weigel.
