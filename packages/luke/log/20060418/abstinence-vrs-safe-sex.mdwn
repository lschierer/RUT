<p>In this day and age, sex ed starts early, something that has made the news more than once, as parents express outrage.  I cannot but wonder if there is a causual relationship between that and the fact that <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com">New York Daily News</a> is reporting that "four out of 10 city kids say they have had intercourse before age 14"<sup><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/406126p-343777c.html" title="40% lose virginity by 14th b'day, survey sez">[1]</a></sup>  Miss Lauren Ferret assures me that no one questions that sex that early in life is wrong.  In light of that understanding, and the above documented reality, I think we need to be questioning if the way we raise our children is resulting in the sort of lives we wanted for them.  Perhaps it is time to look at abstinence as the best policy not only as a matter of Church teaching, but as best from a purely secular light as well.</p>
