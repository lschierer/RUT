OKs Taking Infant Off Life Support</a>" was quickly followed by "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-17-2005/20050217054502_08.html">Court
Reinstates Infant Life-Support Order</a>" such that you can only look
at them together if you really want an accurate view of things.
This is an incredibly sad story, in which society as sunk to
the point that we have to fight in court, and fight such a close
battle in court, for the chance for this little baby to have even
his short life.  I hope his mother's craziness will not undermine
her case.<br  /><br  />

More news on the case of the Chinese girl whose parents want
to take her back from the couple who have been raising them. "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-16-2005/20050216154503_26.html">Tenn.
Court Gets Chinese Girl Custody Case</a>" provides some details the
previous article did not.  This little girl is at risk of being taken
from the only family she knows.  I cannot but feel for both sides
in this one, the parents who want their child back and the family
that wants to stay together.  As that sentence betrays, I think I am
moving towards the side of the Bakers, who currently have the child.
This is a tragedy all around however this case comes out, no need
to wreck this child's life as well as one couple or the other's.
