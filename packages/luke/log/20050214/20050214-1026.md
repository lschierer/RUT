Some lawyer was convicted of passing messages
from imprisoned terrorists to unimpassioned ones.
She claims that the attorney-client privilege
protects her from prosecution for her actions in "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211004504_02.html">Rights
Lawyer Vows to Appeal Conviction</a>."<br  /><br  />

Woman Made Up Tossed Baby Story</a>" is just weird.  The woman
apparently made up a story of someone throwing a baby out a car
window so as to hide the fact that she had been pregnant from her
family.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-11-2005/20050211081516_26.html">Death
Row Retardation Rules Questioned</a>" documents that California
is getting around to dealing with the USSC decision that doesn't
allow you to execute someone with mental retardation.<br  /><br  />

"I was just following orders" as a defense in "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1152/2-11-2005/20050211151508_25.html">Lawyer:
Contractor Beat Afghan As His Duty</a>."  Given how well this worked
at Nuremberg, part of me wonders if this is just being done to keep
the story in the news.<br  /><br  />

NYTimes article "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/politics/14visa.html?ei=5088&en=ed7f28ff2077c9c3&ex=1266123600&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">State
Dept. Relaxes Visa Rules for Some Scientists and Students</a>"
talks about making clearances for foreign students and scientists
last longer, so as to make it more possible for them to work and
study here.  Apparently they need clearances to do just about
anything in "Fields like chemistry, engineering and pharmacology."
Not sure what I think of this.<br  /><br  />

On a lighter note, perhaps, progress in nanotechnology is reported
in "<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news3009.html">Scientists find
flaw in quantum dot construction</a>."
