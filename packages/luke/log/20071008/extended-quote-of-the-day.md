<blockquote markdown="1">Let me be clear.  I am not saying the origin of life was simply an extremely improbable accident.  I am saying the origin of life was deliberately, purposely arranged, just as the fundamental laws and constants and many other anthropic features of nature were deliberately, purposely arranged.  But in what I'll call the "extended-fine-tuning" view, the origin of life is merely an additional planned feature culminating in intelligent life.  The origin of life is simply closer to the very same goal that other, more distant anthropic features (laws, chemical properties, and so forth) were also put in place to bring about.  Nonetheless, just as it was possible to discover a set of proximate conditions that would lead to the origin of the moon, it may also be possible to arrange a local set of conditions that would lead to life, <i>and that would be a scientifically interesting project.</i>  If it succeeded, some would claim that it revealed that life needed no miracle.  But in fact it would show the beginning of life needed a directing intelligence.[^200710071][emphasis added]</blockquote>

This is an important thought.  A key quote.  It contains many ideas all of which are central to Intelligent Design.  It contains one thought, at the end, that many people cannot grasp.  If I do something, if I will an end and achieve it, then I have not proved that it could happen without someone to will it.  I have not proved that it is possible for it to happen randomly.  It is possible, it may even be likely, that it is only with intervention that it can possibly happen.  Take weighted dice.  Not just slightly weighted dice that increase your odds, but do not guarantee a particular outcome, but massively weighted dice.  Dice that if you drop them, will *always* land with a given face up.  You would have to *place* such dice for them to land with the weighted face up, the reverse of what physics tells you should happen.  So too, it is possible that my experiment only shows that intelligence can cause something.

For evolution to be *true*, and not just *possible*, something more is needed.  The bar is higher.   The scientists must prove that something can happen as a result of *undirected*, **unwilled** chance.  Not only that, but for it to form a realistic explanation, they must show that it is **likely to have happened**.

It is *possible*, so I am told by physicists, that the universe could just wink out of existence in a singular quantum event.  It is *possible*, according to that physics, that we winked *into* existence in precisely the same manner one second before you read this.  Neither are particularly likely.  Neither make particularly believable or useful explanations.  

Evolution might be *possible*.  I do not think so, from what I have read, but it might be.  I *sincerely* doubt anyone could argue that it is likely enough to make a believable explanation.  

All the rest is very true.  There *is* a **very** long list of things that have to be just *so* for us to be here.  It defies probability.  It stretches probability that we exist *anywhere*.  Some authors say it even defies probability that we are here anywhere.

If you ask me to believe that there are a multitude of universes, one for each throw of each coin, and that is the best you can do to make sense of the universe, you can take your materialist theories and smoke them.  They are not worth the paper it would take to print them; you have come up with something no more scientific than either of the creation stories found in the Bible.  Any of the three resulting stories (one from the materialists, two from the Bible) might in a literal, historical, sense be true.  None of them qualify as a scientific theory.
