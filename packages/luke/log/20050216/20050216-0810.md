According to <em>George Pell Defender of the Faith Down Under</em>,
by Tess Livingstone, Cardinal Pell has a "vast, well-thumbed library
(around three thousand volumes and growing), which covers theology,
philosophy, literature, history, and numerous other subjects."
To which, I with my 3 or 4 hundred books, can only say "wow."
