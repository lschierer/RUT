Nothing particularly caught my eye in this morning's news, but the
following are worth taking note of, if not sufficient to cause a
post of their own.<br  />

"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4249859.stm">Bad
news really can break hearts</a>" describes that stressful
events can cause symptoms similar to a heart attack.<br  /> "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-9-2005/20050209160015_12.html">House
Immigrants Bill Gets White House OK</a>" brings some changes to
the way immigrants are handled.  They can't use state driver's
licenses for some things like boarding planes or entering
federal buildings, and they can be deported more easily.
I'm not sure what I make of it; the ID changes are most
likely good, the deportation changes I'm less sure of.<br  /> "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001477.htm">GUESS WHO'S
PAYING FOR IT...</a>" is rather disturbing I think.  While I tend
to sympathize with the judge, I can see this sort of precedent
being far too easily abused.
