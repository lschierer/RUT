"<a href="http://www.rednova.com/news/display/?id=126207">Earth
Gets a Warm Feeling All Over</a>" has some interesting implications
that I'd missed, but Vincas was quick to point out.  They are
claiming to have data since 1900, satellites have only really been
available post-Sputnik, and not in any density for years after that.
Just what did they do to record average temperatures across the
oceans and in the Arctic and Antarctic between 1900 and 1960(ish)?
Are we saying that the odd boat crossing, the couple explorations
and research centers, and similar are sufficient?  If so, what does
that mean about the quality of their later measurements?  If they
were gathered with that standard in mind... ;-) However, for all
I know the later measurements might even be trust worthy; still,
can we really base climatology off of 40 years (or less) of data?
