"<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jonahgoldberg/jg20050209.shtml">Defining
monstrosity down</a>" is a really interesting piece.  Rather bluntly,
which I like, Jonah Goldberg says that some acts are monstrous, some
people are monsters, and we need a way, a word with which, to call
them that.  Which raises the question, as Goldberg notes, what's up
with friendly characters like Sesame Street or the Muppet's being
"monsters?"  Not that it does a huge amount of harm, as he writes:

<blockquote>But, you know, it's funny. I think we want - and need -
a word for monsters. For example, my 2-year-old daughter has never
seen a film or a book that would give her the impression monsters as
a group are evil, while she's been inundated with the notion that
they're good and friendly. And yet this lover of "Sesame Street"
is still afraid of monsters. She will use the word and ask me to
scare them away.</blockquote>

Still, one wonders...
