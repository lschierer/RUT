I have not done much with Gaim this week, I have been rather busy with other projects.  I did note that in the forum, there are predictions that Gaim as a project will fail because of the selfishness of its current developers.  Apparently it will fail to the point that it will be necessary for some other developers (who are supposedly less selfish) to "pick it up."  

Sean Egan makes an interesting point here:

<blockquote>I still got a kick out of the way as soon we released a Windows port, we went from extraordinarily successful, 5-year-old, pinnacle of software development to be admired by all, to fledgling new project that had better do everything everyone wants if it ever wants to consider succeeding</blockquote>

Though I suspect that a fair few of these complaints and predictions are coming from GNOME users as well.
