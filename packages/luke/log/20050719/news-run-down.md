<p>Things are really busy right now, so just a quick run down.</p>  <ul> <li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/07-19-2005/49e700131afa0fe0.html">Judge Narrows Pledge of Allegiance Lawsuit</a>" by David Kravets of the Associated Press, from Monday, July 18, 2005.  While the Judge is attempting to avoid the Pledge of Allegiance itself from being directly declared unconstitutional, I really fail to see how it matters if the Pledge cannot be used in schools and other government funded events.</li> <li>"<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4410">Adoption agency rejects Catholic parents</a>," a Catholic News Agency(CNA) report from July 18, 2005.  Just some documentation of protestants treating Catholics as non-Christians.</li> <li>"<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4399">Moving ‘Ninth Day’, depicts often ignored Nazi abuse of Catholics</a>," another CNA report, this one from July 15, 2005.  So often you will see a radically critical look at the Church during World War II, and just as often, you will hear statements that make it seem that Jews were the only significantly persecuted body.  It is nice to hear that there is to be a movie with a more just account.</li> <li>"<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4397">Anglican bishop suspends priest opposed to ordination of gays</a>," CNA is rapidly becoming one of my more significant news sources. This report is also from July 15, 2005.  I have been watching the news articles talking about the entire Anglican mess dealing with the issue of homosexuality.  I must say that I rather hope it causes fragmentation, because I strongly suspect that such fragmentation would lead to an increased number of Anglicans rejoining the Church.  I also tend to think that the only way we will see the end of the Protestant heresy is that it is and will continue to slowly dissolve in the modernist heresy, and that the sooner this happens, the less confusion there will be as the Church attempts to face and defeat this more threatening heresy.</li> <li>"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4675545.stm">Public split over new hate laws</a>," from the BBC, July 18, 2005. Along the same lines as the last, this article looks at homosexual clergy, the influence of religion in the public life, and hate laws regarding religion.  Focusing only on this last, which is, or seems to me a minority of the article, I tend to be really leery of such laws.  It seems that it would be too easy to charge a Priest under them for teaching that all religions are not equal, or that the Muslim faith is wrong to allow multiple "marriages."</li> </ul>
