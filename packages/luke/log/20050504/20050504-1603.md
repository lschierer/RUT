<p> Cal Thomas <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/calthomas/ct20050502.shtml">is
upset</a> that we are not to torture terrorist suspects or captured
terrorists.  He says that the "greater good" of saving thousands or
perhaps millions of lives justifies it.  Apparently he is not aware
of the long standing judicial tradition of preferring to let guilty
men go free rather than unjustly imprisoning (much less torturing)
one innocent man.  He is also apparently unaware that the ends do
not <em>ever</em> justify the means.</p>
