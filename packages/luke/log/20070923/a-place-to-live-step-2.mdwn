The home inspection went well.  It turned up 2 fogged windows and one non-functional power outlet.  We have no clue yet if the seller will be willing to fix them or not.  I have a little bit of trouble being overly concerned about either.  There is also a large pane of glass for the sliding door to be replaced, but the seller told us about that, and listed it as an "as is" item.  Still, that leaks air into the unheated but contained sun room, so the overall heat loss should be diminished to the point that it is only "important" to get it fixed and not "critical."  

Lauren and I filled out what seemed like a ream of forms for the loan application.  I need to find out what, exactly, is the next step.  What else, between now and closing, do I have to schedule and/or be there for, versus what just sort of happens automatically as a result of the balls we have now set in motion?  It is this sort of question that makes me very glad that we chose to have a real estate agent, and also that we know Andy to guide us through the loan side of things.  I doubt the seller's agent would be anywhere near so responsive and helpful.
