I went out to lunch today with my wonderful girlfriend today.  She chose to give me her gift today rather than tomorrow, as this was our time together.  So lo and behold, she has given me <i>The Small Woman</i>.<sup>[1]</sup>  Lately I have been reading a book on Shakespeare, given to me at Christmas this last year, but I have decided to put that on hold for now in favor of this.  The story of this unlikely missionary intrigues me in a way that Shakespeare does not.  

Which is not to say that a book attempting to demonstrate the Cathlicity of Shakespeare is uninteresting; I was finding the book well worth reading.  But lately I have been wanting something far more a story, and yet not really knowing what I want to read.  I do not really want to read my staple science fiction or fantasy right now.  This non-fiction story should hit the spot nicely. &#x263a;
