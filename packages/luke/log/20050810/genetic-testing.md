<p>In <a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/index.php?s=gatica">Gatica News</a>, the Seattle Times has a guest column which mentions that a railroad company has looked to genetic testing in a (fortunately failed) bid to avoid liability for worker's injuries.<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002423250_sundaygenome07.html">[1]</a> Apparently they hoped an "unproven test" would demonstrate a predisposition that would allow them to avoid workman's compensation claims.  This sort of testing is exactly like the situation "Gatica" portrays, and ought to be a cause of concern.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Collins, Francis S.
