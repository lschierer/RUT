<p> Charles Krauthammer is a hypocrite.
Fairly blatantly so.  At the top of "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/charleskrauthammer/ck20050311.shtml">Thou
Shalt Not Create</a>," after quoting President Bush's commitment
to end research on human embryos, he says

<blockquote>That declaration drew more than applause. It received a
standing ovation from both sides of the aisle -- demonstrating that
even amid the confusion and dishonesty in this country's bioethics
debates, some truths remain self-evident. And one of those truths is
that human embryos are to be created for the purpose of producing
human babies, not for commerce and not to be dismembered for study
or spare parts.</blockquote>

but further down in his article, he's not opposed to, is in fact
in favor of using the discarded embryos from IVF for research.
Apparently, in his eyes, it is okay to destroy a human embryo if
you create it for some other purpose, but not if you create it to
destroy it.  The hypocrisy here is nearly self evident, but I suppose
I must acknowledge that there is one loophole.  I would argue that
IVF is equally immoral, and equally deserves to be banned.  It is,
just as cloning would, creating human life with the intent to end
it: to discard most of the created embryos.  It is possible that
this logic, self-evident to me, has not occurred to him.  If so,
he is not a hypocrite, but an fool.  Were he ever to read these
words, he might not like that appellation any better. ;-)</p>
