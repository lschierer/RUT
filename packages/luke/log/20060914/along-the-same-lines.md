"By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the social-assistance state leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients." &mdash;Pope John Paul II, <i>Centesimus annus</i> (1991)
