>All kinds of very important things have to be determined (think of criminal trials) based on incomplete evidence. In those cases we don’t try to create a repeatable experiment that “proves” or “disproves” it. And we don’t throw up our hands when it becomes clear that an experiment is not going to answer the question with 100% certainty. Instead, we assemble the evidence and weigh it.[^20130102-2]
