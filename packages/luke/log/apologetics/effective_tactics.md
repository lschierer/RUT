In February 2006, as Muslims rioted, burned, bombed, and closed newspapers in
response to some offensive cartoons, a contrast become evident.  So evident that
even Mrs. Michelle Malkin, who has helped fuel the fires (more on that in a
moment), has noted it.[^20060210-1]  Ms. Jennifer Siegel writes more on this
contrast, expanding on the unjust nature of a comparison of Catholic protests of
offensive speech and Muslim protests.[^20060210-2]  In short, we have been
peaceful, while they have not only threatened death and destruction, but have
carried out those threats.   If you cannot see a difference there, a hugely
significant one, then I submit that you really are not capable of rational
discussion.

We do ourselves no favors however, either in a push to advance free speech nor
in a push for conversion, when we fan the flames of Muslim militancy as Mrs.
Malkin has done.  Mr. Alejandro Bermudez explains why.[^20060210-3]  Any attack
on religion, any religion, *as a religion* is a threat to all of us.  The same
papers in which these cartoons originated are equally well known for attacking
Catholics.  Further, to republish these cartoons is not going to help convince
Muslims to be less violent, nor is it going to help convert them to the true
faith.  This is not an example of equalization nor of apologetics.  It is
simply attacking a religion for no reason other than the fact that that faith is
an easy target right now.

While we clearly cannot give in to threats of violence, we also should not be
eager to spread these cartoons.  We should find other ways to encourage free
speech in the face of this attack on it.  For the suppression of these cartoons
is equally unproductive, done in the manner currently attempted.  Far from a
peaceful protest aimed at demonstrating the poor logic of publishing them, these
attacks are aimed at silencing *all* criticism and *all* dissent. This was not an
effective tactic during the age of the Inquisition, nor is it effective now.  A
boycott or a peaceful protest works by reminding publishers where their money
comes from.  It does not make economic sense to offend your customer base.  It
makes them remember you and your concerns without fearing you or hating you.  A
death threat or a bomb threat can also work, in the sense that you can stop
publishers from publishing, but you do so by making them fear and hate you.  You
convince them of the truth of the material you suppress even as you suppress it.
This means that, in the long run, more of that material will be produced.  It
will just be distributed differently.
