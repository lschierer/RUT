* CCC 983: "Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would be no
  hope of life to come or eternal liberation." 
* Sin is real.
  * Sin is not the same as mistakes, imperfections, or immaturities. 
  * Sin is a separation from God
  * The denial of the *possibility* of sin is a relatively new idea
    * that is not to say that *particular people* have not denied that *they
      individually* have sinned.  Such people historically would have said
      *others* are sinners. 
    * The modern mistake is unique in that people now deny that sin exists *at
      all*, and particularly deny that what Catholics understand as mortal sin
      exists at all. 
  * Two kinds of sin: actual sin and original sin. 
    * "actual sin" is something we do.
    * "original sin" refers to our state or condition of lacking grace (God's
      life). It further refers to our fallen nature.
  * original sin
    * It is difficult to understand what humanity would have been like had Adam
    * our instincts are selfish. 
    * we have to train ourselves to resist the effects of this instinctual
      selfishness. 
    * Calvin incorrectly taught that man is totally depraved (evil).  This is
      wrong.
    * Some earlier thinkers, notably the Manichaeism heresy, taught that all
      matter is evil. This is also wrong. 
      not sinned. 
    * Predestination, an idea that heavily influences Presbyterian theology,
      says that God created us without free will, and that because of original
      sin, some (perhaps many?) people *cannot* help but sin.  They have no
      choice. This is wrong. Sin is always a choice. 
    * Sin is habit forming, we are *conditioned* to sin, 
      * in that it becomes easier to sin with each sin we commit. 
      * in that due to original sin, or starting state is inclined to sin 
* God revealed himself first to the Jews then even more profoundly to us as
  Christians, in a unique way as compared to other people.
  * This lead first the Jews, and then us, to understand sin in a more
    profound way, as the breaking of a relationship, and not just disobedience
    to an arbitrary command of an impersonal god (lower case intentional, to
    distinguish between the false gods of of other religions). 
  * The offense of sin against God is infinite, so great that Jesus' death on
    the cross is the only way to pay the debt of justice. 
  * God is Truth, and Truth requires Justice. 
  * God, through His death on the cross, took on, and met the demands of
    Justice for us.  If a lack of Justice is understood as a debt, He paid our
    debt. 
  * Because sin is inherently an offense primarily against God, only God can
    forgive sins.  To claim to forgive sins, is to claim God's authority.  The
    Jews recognized this, and got upset.  The Church claims to be given this
    divine authority by Jesus. 
* The Church forgives sins through the sacraments
  * Baptism forgives all sin, completely. 
    * Baptism does not remove the weakness of will, and other forms of
      "concupiscence" that we inherit as part of original sin. 
    * Baptism gives us grace.
  * Penance/Reconciliation/Confession (same thing, different names)
    * forgives sins committed after baptism
    * requires the sins be confessed and sincerely repented
    * The power to forgive sins, unlike the power to baptize, is reserved to the
      priesthood. 
  * When Saint Paul talks about unforgivable sins, he is talking about the sins
    of despair and impenitence.  Only the unrepentanted and/or unconfessed sin
    cannot be forgiven.  All sins confessed in the sacrament and sincerely
    repented are forgiven. 
* Hell is real
  * Hell is eternal separation from God. 
  * Hell is *both* a judgment of God as an act of Justice *and* an rejection
    by the unrepentant soul turning away from God.
  * Hell is a necessary consequence of free will. 
* God's power is through His spoken word.  He creates by speaking in Genesis,
  and the fullness of God's power is Jesus, who is described as The Word.
  * If God' power is His word, when God says "you are forgiven" His words have
    _**POWER**_.
  * Protestants talk of Justification, as if God's forgiveness is a transaction
    in which God chooses to ignore our sins because Jesus has paid for them, but
    the sin remains.  It is as if Jesus' sacrifice "covers" our sins the way the
    priest's white alb covers whatever he wears underneath.  
  * Catholics speak of Salvation, because we recognize that while we are in fact
    Justified, we are *also* in fact saved.  Our sins are not just paid for
    (justification), but actually removed from us (salvation).  See above, God's
    words have _**POWER**_.
  * This is part of what we mean by the grace of the sacraments.  This power
    fills us, and in turn *empowers* us to do good in turn. 
  * If we are *not* doing good in turn, it is because we are *not* filled with
    grace, which means we *are not saved*.  
    * Not because our works save us, but  because the nature of a saint (someone
      who is saved) is to be a person who uses this power God has filled him or
      her with.
    * You can tell a tree by its fruit.  If a person doesn't act like a saint,
      the person isn't a saint.  
    * In the protestant view, the sinner remains a sinner.  Catholics believe
      that God's forgiveness removes the sin from us.
    * More, the Catholic view is that God has given us grace - God's own life
      and power within us.  God is acting *through us* to do good.  The evidence
      of that should be visible.
    * We thus become saints while still here on earth.  
* Because we are *entirely* dependent ant God's mercy, it behooves us to show
  mercy to others.
