* Only God is eternal.
  * Only God is necessary in his own being.  That is, only God *has* to exist. 
  * Our relationship with God is eternal because God is eternal. 
  * Our relationship with God is necessary for *our* being. 
* The book starts with the statement that every reader of the book will die.
  This is true.  
  * However, it lead to the question (in class), did Mary die? 
    * Definitively, *we do not know*.  
    * The Church teaches "at the end of her life" she was assumed, body and
      soul, into heaven.
    * Some church fathers believe and have argued that this statement means that
      she was assumed at the moment she *would* have died. 
    * Other church fathers believe and have argued that this statement means
      that she was assumed _just after_ she died. 
    * The Church has *refused* to clarify this point. It definitively *does not
      teach* which set of church fathers is correct.  This is a nearly unique
      situation.  A matter of significant debate on a matter of faith for
      literally centuries is left entirely undefined. 
  * Death means the separation of the body from the soul. 
    * remember, we as human are created to be both body and soul. 
    * Death comes to man because of sin. 
    * Death is natural in that we are part of material creation
    * death is unnatural in that we have immortal souls
    * death is supernatural in that it is our path to eternal life.
    * to be properly understood, we must keep in mind *all three*
    * death is not extinction (atheism)
    * death is not reincarnation 
    * at death we do not become angels. 
* The resurrection of the body was slowly revealed
  * the further back you go in the Old Testament, the less clearly *any* Jews
    understood it.
  * Even in Jesus' time some important groups of Jews denied this concept. This
    is part of why the Jews expected the Messiah to be king here on Earth. 
* The Christian attitude towards death is best summarized in the single word
  "readiness"
  * We are ready for God to call us to live longer here on Earth.
  * We are ready for God to call us to join Him in heaven at any time. 
    * Now.
    * Tomorrow.
    * 100 years from now. 
  * We work to avoid sin, particularly mortal sin(summarizing the books' summary
    of CCC 1014)
    * partly to maintain this readiness (fear of hell) 
    * partly for love of God (the better we are, the more true this one is)
  * The Church encourages us to pray for deliverance from "a sudden and
    unforeseen death." (CCC 1014). 
* after death comes *Particular Judgment*
  * you face God alone and are *both* judged *and* judge yourself. The two
    judgments will be identical.  There is no denial or lying in the face of
    God.  
  * as a result of this Judgment, you face heaven or hell.  
    * your road to heaven may involve going through purgatory. 
    * all who attain heaven do so because of God's mercy. 
      * This mercy is experienced through the Church.  
        * first through the grace of Baptism. 
          * we did not discuss this *this* class. 
        * secondly through the grace of the sacrament of Reconciliation
          * there was some discussion on this. It will be further discussed
            later in the year, in hopefully better clarity when I am not trying
            to focus on other things. 
 * at the end of time comes the "General Judgment"
   * everyone from all of history will stand before God and be, individually,
     judged a second time, this time publicly.
     * the results of this second judgment will in no way ever differ from the
       results of the first, particular, judgment.
     * This second judgment exists to meet the demands of Justice.
       * why do good things happen to bad people?
       * why do bad things happen to good people?
       * Why did God allow xyz to happen? 
       * Justice demands these questions be answered definitively. 
   * We will be reunited body and soul.
     * the good will be reunited with their bodies, to better experience
       heaven.
     * the bad will be reunited with their bodies to better experience hell
       (that is, to experience even more pain). 
     * Our resurrected bodies will differ from our present bodies ( I draw on
       some material not available in the book here)
       * We are conformed to Christ.
       * We will be approximately the age Christ was at his Ascension.
       * Our bodies will be perfectly obedient to our will
         * we will not be clumsy
         * that does not mean we will have abilities we do not already have
         * we will not suffer temptation from disordered desire
       * We will be able to travel as Christ did between the Resurrection and
         the Ascension.  
         * instantaneously over distance
         * through walls
       * We will be recognizable, but only if someone takes the time to *really*
         look, we will not look precisely like a photograph of us.   
       * We will have an actual body, it will eat, it can be touched.
         * We are told in the bible that the idea of marriage will not make
           sense.  Why it will not make sense is not explained.
* belief in the resurrection of the body is important
  * God created the body and called it "good"
  * God created *us* to be fully human - both body and soul, the top of the
    physical world.  Our eternal life needs to reflect that. 
  * Because our bodies are destined for eternity, both our own bodies, and those
    of others, are to be treated with respect.( CCC 1004)
