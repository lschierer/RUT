1. While human reason demands a creator, Judaism was the first *religion* to
   teach this. 
1. Only God can create in the truest sense.  Humans can make something out of
   something else, only God can create something out of nothing.  The book goes
   into some detail to explain how this explains and fits with what we learned
   in earlier sections.
1. God's role as creator has implications for us, and how we live, things we can
   know from this fact (God is our Creator) alone.
   a. God is the ultimate cause of all that we do.
   a. God has absolute authority over us, we have no right to complain about
      God's actions (or lack of action).
   a. God did not *have* to create us. 
   a. We can trust God (because He *must be* good).
   a. God is "immanent."  This means that is not infinitely remote (as the
      deists believe, but always present everywhere and every-when.  We are never
      truly alone.
1. Even if evolution is true, it does not and cannot explain souls.  Only Faith
   can explain them. 
1. Primary (First) and Secondary Causes. 
   a. God is the First cause of everything.
   a. God often works through secondary causes.
   a. This neither diminishes God nor His creation.  In fact, it makes both
      greater.
   a. Praying to saints is an example of utilizing God's power via a secondary
      cause.  This is done because God *wants* to work this way.  See the prior
      bullet point.
1. Creation is a hierarchy, some things are both more important and more
   valuable than others. 
   a. We can eat meat because we are *not* animals. 
   a. The creation story in Genesis is intended to teach us the truth of this
      hierarchy.
1. God is creator of "all that is, seen and unseen" (Nicene Creed; CCC 325).
   a. Humans are a hybrid, we are physical bodies (seen) and spiritual souls
      (unseen).
   a. Angels are beings of pure spirit (unseen).
   a. Humans are the highest of the physical world and the lowest of the
      spiritual world.
1. Angels and Demons.
   a. In a sense, these are the same thing, they differ in that Angels chose to
      obey God, and demons chose to rebel against Him.
   a. In class we talked about the 9 choirs of angels, and their roles as
      secondary causes.
   a. The book *briefly* mentions the way demons tempt us. We went into more
      detail in class, both in how they act, and the limits of their power.
1. The book goes into great depth about the problem of evil, which has only
   briefly been covered in prior books.  This is a concern only if it troubles
   you or your child.  It is important that you (and your child) know that *this
   can be explained* and *where to look to get reliable answers* on this topic.
   * The catechism
   * the writings of the saints
   * other official teaching documents of the Church (including in a very small
     way the text book).
