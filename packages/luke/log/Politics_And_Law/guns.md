* USA Today presents a balanced report on a new study from Boston Children's Hospital.[^20130317-1]
  * States with the most laws had a mortality rate 42% lower than those states with the fewest laws
  * No correlation with type of laws passed, nor with enforcement of laws.
  * Study admits it fails to find a causual link.
  * Study fails to look at gun ownership rates.
  * "The larger problem is that the United States effectively stopped doing research on gun laws and violence 15 years ago and now has no evidence that shows causes and effect."[^20130317-2]
