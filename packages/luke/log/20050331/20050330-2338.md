<p> I can now receive and display trackback pings.  Many many thanks
to Vincas for translating the perl-ish specifications and examples
into something I could understand, and for helping me think through
the design.  He has also promised to write me something to be able
to send them with.  Very cool, this little home-brew set-up is
joining the 21st century. <big>&#x263a;</big></p>
