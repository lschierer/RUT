<p>The New York Times thinks it newsworthy that several scientists, including Dr. Kenneth Miller and an ex Dominican, Dr. Francisco J. Ayala, have written to the Pope asking for a clarification of the Church's teaching on evolution.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/13/national/13pope.html?ex=1278907200&en=32dfb36744c66fe8&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss ">[1]</a> I can only hope that the Pope does so; I doubt Dr. Miller will be pleased.  For some reason though the headline says they are asking the Pope, the article says the letter is "en route to Cardinal Sch√∂nborn."  I read in Pope John Paul II's words none of the endorsement for the more materialist versions of evolution that Dr. Miller seems to find.  Given though that he has made a name for himself as a Catholic biologist supporting evolution, it comes as no real surprise that he would question and hope for some way to continue to say that he is in line with the rest of the Church.  he would not be half so quotable if he stood in marked opposition to the Church's stance on evolution after all.  Still, I think this is a risk for him to take.  I think he's hoping that Pope Benedict XVI will balk at issuing a statement that could be used to characterize the Church as suppressing scientific inquiry. The Church <em>does not</em> suppress scientific inquiry nor deny the use of science, so there is some logic to such a hope. It will be interesting and informative to read what, if anything, our Pope writes in response.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Dean, Cornelia.
