<p>Instead of tolerating a bad culture,<a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050711-1431/the-fruits-of-toleration">[1]</a> the Christian confronts it and rebukes it.<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/marvinolasky/mo20050707.shtml">[2]</a></p>  <blockquote>Bonga, 18, wasn't buying. "Black people are not the same as white people," he said. "Black people do not abstain." Smith responded: "I understand that the Zulu people like to say they do things differently. But this is not about what Rob thinks, nor about what the white man thinks. This is about what God thinks. If you reject this, you're not rejecting man, but God."<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/marvinolasky/mo20050707.shtml">[2]</a></blockquote>  <font size="-2"> [1] Schierer, Luke.
