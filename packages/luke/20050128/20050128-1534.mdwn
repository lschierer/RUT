Just a short note, I just read the latest installment of *[Exercise Your Wonder](http://www.arn.org/eyw.htm)*
by Dr. Howard Glicksman over at [Access Research Network](http://www.arn.org/),
a nice repository of some Intelligent Design papers, books, and other resources.
I highly recommend Dr. Glicksman's articles for anyone who actually wants to
think about exactly what materialistic science claims has evolved.  Dr.
Glicksman presents a compelling case that the human body is a highly complex and
inter-dependent construct, and challenges you to **think** "could this really
have evolved?".  Most people I find do not want to really think.  They want to
believe what they are taught and told by "authorities" (scientists in this
case).  And it doesn't help that so much of the response against intelligent
design comes in the form of attacks against the authors (that keep
them out of the main-stream journals), and over simplification of
their arguments.  Its fairly easy to get people to dismiss 7 day
creation, and if you can keep people thinking that the choice is
between that or evolution, then the argument is pretty much over. :-(
