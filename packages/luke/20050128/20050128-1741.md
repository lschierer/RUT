So I realized today why I'm having trouble with single and double
quotes for my mom's poems.  WordPerfect, like MSWord, isn't using
real quotes. It is using "Fancy" or "Curly" quotes.  Now I just
need to learn how to turn that off. :-)<br  /><br  />

Once I have that working, I should be able to trust my code to
create web pages correctly.  I'll be moving her over to a slightly
different submit form that works better for just about everything
else she'll hit.  And once I can trust the code to write web pages
directly, I can generate more than just the web page, I can generate
other views than simply alphabetical.  On a side note, if I can
learn about creation time and such from php, then I can do this now,
and not have to generate a static page for each other view.<br  /><br  />

<strong>Update 17:55:</strong> And it turns out I can learn this,
and so <a href="http://www.schierer.org/~ann/date.php">this
page</a> now exists, after a custom compare function to use
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filemtime.php">this
function</a>. :-D
