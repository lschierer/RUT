Something rather amusing happened today.  I realized that one of my less computer inclined friends was never aware of our name change.  He discovered Pidgin from a list of clients on the LiveJournal website, downloaded it, and was very confused as to why installing it caused Gaim to disappear.  Yay for people for whom this mess is of so little importance!! <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font>
