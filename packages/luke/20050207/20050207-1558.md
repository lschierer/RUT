Democrats are all about saying how there is money
in the trust fund to last far longer than President
Bush's projections.  David Frum refutes this in a way
that even I can be reliably trusted to repeat.  He <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/frum/diary020605.asp#055438">writes</a><br  />

<blockquote>If you or I held hundreds of billions of dollars of
Treasury bills, we'd think ourselves pretty comfortably provided for.
So if T-bills are good enough for Bill Gates and the Bank of Japan,
why aren't they good enough to secure the future of America's
retirees?<br  /><br  />

NRO readers, being a sophisticated bunch, have probably already
spotted the fallacy here.  If Fred writes an IOU for $10 to Jim,
Jim has an asset.  But if Fred writes an IOU to Fred for $10,
he has not created an asset for himself &#x2014; he's created a
reminder notice.<br  /><br  />

And that's the situation of the Trust Fund.<br  /><br  />

One branch of the US government (the Treasury) owes another branch
(the Trust Fund) a bunch of money.  The question is not whether
those IOUs are legally binding.  Of course they are.  The question
is: Does the existence of those IOUs in any way make it easier for
the US government to pay Social Security benefits?  And the answer
to that is of course not.<br  /><br  />

That's why the crucial fact about Social Security is not the legal
question of how many bonds it has.  The crucial fact about Social
Security is the economic question: When will the demands on the
system exceed the system's revenues?  Currently, the crossover
point is estimated to be thirteen years from now.</blockquote><br  />
