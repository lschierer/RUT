According to "<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050205-4589.html">New
Orleans gets cameras for the crooks (and the cops?)</a>,"
New Orleans has become the third city (that I have heard
of) to install surveillance cameras on its streets.  The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/index.ars">ars technica</a> writer
thinks that this may aid in protecting citizens from police abuse as
well as monitoring them as potential criminals, but I have my doubts.
Tapes in the control of police are going to be used against them?
I don't think so.
