Ederlyn would find <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050205-4590.html">this</a>
cool.  I tend to find it scary.  My capacity for cynicism is very
nearly in paranoia mode, and I cannot seem to curb it.  Science is
consistently blurring the lines between life and non-life.  In
<em>Diamond Age</em>, Neil Stephenson writes that the Catholic Church
(paraphrasing a science fiction novel set in the future here) argued
for a while and then decided that nanotech was okay as long as it
was not used to interface with the human brain.  I'm not sure that is
the line the Church would draw.  I'm <strong><em>really</em></strong>
not sure where it <em>should</em> be drawn.  I <em>do</em> know that
it <strong><em>must</em></strong> be drawn, and that we cannot trust
scientists, especially not materialistic ones, to draw the line.
This isn't really nanotech, but to my mind it falls into much
the same category.  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">ars</a>
correctly draws parallels to the Terminator&#xae; series.  I don't
know how possible that is, it really comes down to two questions,
1)the possibility of AI and 2)the limits of human stupidity.  I know
not to limit the latter; <em>Diamond Age</em> speculates that there
are limits to the former, but I question not only that assertion,
but whether or not the limits would be significant enough to prevent
a Terminator&#xae;.
