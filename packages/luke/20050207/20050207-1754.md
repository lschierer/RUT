"<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/richlowry/rl20050204.shtml">Civil
libertarians against public health</a>" partially documents some
progress at treating AIDS sanely in New York City.  They went from
scaring pregnant women such that they did not get tested at all,
to ensuring that the parents of every baby born with AIDS will
know to get the baby treated, and thus changing the counseling so
that many babies do not contract AIDS from their mothers at all.
Of particular note: "According to The New York Times, in 1990 there
were 321 newborns infected with HIV in New York City. In 2003 there
were five."
