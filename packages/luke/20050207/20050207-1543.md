New York is joining ranks with Massachusetts in allowing
same sex "marriage" it seems.  According to Samuel Maull in "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-4-2005/20050204110009_33.html">N.Y.
Ban on Same-Sex Marriage Struck Down</a>," the law forbidding this
union is against the New York State constitution.  The ruling is,
however, still subject to appeal; let us hope that sanity returns
to this state.
