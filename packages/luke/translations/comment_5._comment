<p>As a statement of faith, what does our response, "And with your spirit." mean?  "Amen" would seem a more logical response to "The Lord be with you" <em>or</em>  "The peace of the Lord be with you."  The response "And with your spirit" does not seem like I am <em>stating</em> anything following what appears to be a blessing.</p>

<p>Still, with that additional quote, I am able, after I think about it for a while, how it is intended as a statement of faith.  The Priest says "The Lord be with you" and we reply (paraphrasing to demonstrate the way I am understanding it) "as He is with your spirit or soul because of your ordination;" completing the priest's sentence as it were.</p>

<p>I do not like it though.  Not because it is less personal or friendly, but because I have to wrestle with the phrasing to make sense of it, even after I am given the origin.</p>
