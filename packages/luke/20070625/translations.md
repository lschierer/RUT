Understand, I am all for accurate translations.  I also agree with Mr. George Weigel in saying that Catholics are not, by and large, morons, and can handle big words and complex ideas.[^weigel1]  I am told that the current English translation of the Mass is exceptionally poor, and that the new one being worked on is much closer to the original Latin.  That is well and good, and I can very much support that.

Still, it strikes me as odd that rendering “Et cum spiritu tuo” as "and also with your spirit" in place of "and also with you" is used as an example here of how the new translation is better.  While more no doubt more accurate, *what does it mean&#x203d;*  I have no idea, and and so I strongly suspect that this particular example more strongly supports the idea that the new translation is confusing.

That does *not* mean that we should not use the new translation.  The Faith should not be dumbed down.  It *does* mean that our bishops and pastors need to step up to the plate and teach us.  I do not understand that response, and if it is part of the Mass, I should understand what I am saying.  Provide me an accessible reference please.
