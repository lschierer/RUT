<p>For all it seems to me that embryonic stem cell research is unnecessary, given the lack of success in its trials, and the incredible success in adult stem cell research, it is nice to see that we now have a moral way of procuring such stem cells.<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4250">[1]</a> If the article is accurate, no new life is created, and thus no murder takes place as these stem cells are harvested.  This development makes all the more inexcusable the votes of those Catholic Representatives that I listed earlier.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Catholic News Agency.
