<p>Oh, I forgot to mention, yesterday I was having no end of trouble with software serial numbers.  So much so that I called apple twice (the second time, I did not reach them, it was after 6pm pdt). So today I call them as soon as they open, only to get told the serial numbers should work, and surprisingly, they do!! What in the world is up with that?  I really have no clue.  I did not even have to type them in again, just press save again.</p>
