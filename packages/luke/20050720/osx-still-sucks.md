<p>So after staying up late last night, today some things just magically start working and others continue to frustrate. Netboot sucks.  Badly.  I managed to get it to <em>work</em>, but it doesn't help, because I do not know how to make it install automatically, and I cannot ssh to the images that I have managed to create.  I found a firewire cable and am now using the mac mini as a target disk.  Hopefully this will work, if it does not, I do not know what I will do.</p>
