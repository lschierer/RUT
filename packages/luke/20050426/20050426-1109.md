<p> George Will <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/georgewill/gw20050424.shtml">thinks</a>
that the decline in newspaper circulation is "ominous."  Other than
the obvious conflict of interest, I really don't see any reason
why he thinks this is the case.  When did the print media last do
anything particularly useful?</p>
