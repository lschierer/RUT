Someone will raise the terrorism issue, how terrorists could use VoIP to avoid detection, and it will be downhill from there.</p>  <p>Which raises the question (Mr.?) Uwe Hermann asks.<sup><a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/how-to-detect-and-defeat-hardware-backdoors-and-wiretaps" title="How to detect and defeat hardware backdoors and wiretaps?">[2]</a></sup> Given that CALEA will be extended, and that hackers will take advantage of whatever backdoors are introduced, how do we handle this?  How can we detect what backdoors are available and defend against them?</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Mr. Dennis O'Reilly.  "Could Your VoIP Phone Be Tapped?"
