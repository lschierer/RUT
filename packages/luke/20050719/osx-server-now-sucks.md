<p>I take back all the nice things I said about MacOSX server. It may install easily enough, but the dhcp and netboot stuff both error out, there is no documentation on the error messages, nothing on google, and apple will not support it.  That sucks. Oh, and to top it all off, you cannot use admin tools from a 10.3 machine to control a 10.4 server, you must have a 10.4 client. I <strong><em>hate</em></strong> forced upgrades.</p>
