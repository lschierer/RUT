<p>Cardinal Schönborn wrote an editorial Thursday last week clarifying the Church's teaching on evolution, which many misunderstand.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html?pagewanted=print">[1]</a> In keeping with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, he stated that the details of history are left to science, and that some forms of evolution are compatible with the Catholic faith. He asserted, however, that the "Neo-Darwinian" evolution, which insists on unguided and unplanned formation, is not. His statement is remarkably clear, and I recommend reading it (assuming you can get to it past the registration requirement).  People were quick to react with dismay. An article in the science section the soon after describes "Darwinian evolution" as the "foundation of modern science."<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/science/09cardinal.html?ei=5088&en=0c18342598665e77&ex=1278561600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print">[2]</a> Note that this <em>starts</em> off with a misrepresentation. Evolutions' proponents had listened only where convenient to our previous pope, and are now claiming that the Church has changed its position.  How typical.  Dr. Kenneth Miller, and odd man who claims to be Catholic yet has no problems disagreeing with the Church on this matter, is quoted prominently, but another scientist, Dr. Francis Collins,is more willing to accept "Theistic evolution," which is compatible with the Catholic Faith.</p>  <p>ARN, naturally enough, provides some balance here, asking good questions and pointing out that most people really will not be all that shocked or concerned by the good Cardinal's statements.<a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/3/2005/07/09/leading_cardinal_redefines_church_s_view">[3]</a></p>   <font size="-2"> [1] Schönborn, Christoph.
