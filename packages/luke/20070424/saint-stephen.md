Today's first reading is from the Acts of the Apostles, telling about the martyrdom of Saint Stephen.[^1]  Reading this, I am reminded that sometimes it is more important to proclaim the Truth than to remain on good terms with your listeners.  

That being said, whenever possible, to do both is far better.  Saint Stephen, help all those who attempt to stand up for the Truth of the Faith today and always. 

[^1]: [Acts 7:51â€”8:1a](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/acts/acts7.htm#v51)
