I totally forgot when I wrote my mom's poem viewer that the php "include" command would include remote files.  Someone from Argentina took advantage of this fact to hack my server yesterday night, a fact I learned yesterday morning.

Unfortunately my work backing up the data I wanted to preserve was far from complete.  Most notably, I lost my cron jobs, my iptables script, and all but the photos from my gallery2 install, as the mysql dump alone appears to be next to useless.

Further, in bringing the mail server back up, I neglected to ensure my .qmail files were in place _before_ starting the mail server, so I'm pretty sure I lost mail.  Lovely.
