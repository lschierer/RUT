<p> Unsurprisingly, the NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/international/worldspecial2/22germany.html?ei=5088&en=deb8ac4c18fa6d14&ex=1271822400&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all&position=
">has trouble with</a> the idea that Pope Benedict XVI can at
once be theologically orthodox and unwilling to violate or attempt
to change Church doctrine, but at the same time be a shy, loving,
and personable man.</p>

<blockquote>In interviews with friends, neighbors, former students
and colleagues, a paradoxical image of Benedict XVI emerges: a man
whose sharp words and unyielding views as the Vatican's prefect of
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith mask a softer side,
a shyness and an instinct to avoid confrontation.</blockquote>

<p>I really don't see the conflict here.  It is a good
example of humility, and a good example of knowing what is
important.</p>
