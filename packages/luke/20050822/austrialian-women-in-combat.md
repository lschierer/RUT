<p>Nearly as disturbing is the news that Australia is moving those women who choose to serve in its armed forces nearer to combat.  While apparently still not in actual combat roles, they are now on the front line itself "in support roles such as clerical, medical, transport and logistics posts."<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4172538.stm">[1]</a> Apparently, somehow, this increased risk of death and dismemberment makes the military a "more attractive career option" for Australia's women.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4172538.stm">[2]</a> I will tell you what it <em>does</em> do, it puts their entire military force at greater risk, as these women will be less capable of assisting those around them survive the physical demands of combat, and as the men around them must fight with their instincts to act as the gentlemen they should be.</p>  <p>On a side note, I am sure this will make it all the harder here.<a href="http://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050519-0957/20050519-0957">[3]</a></p>  <font size="-2"> [1] BBC News.
