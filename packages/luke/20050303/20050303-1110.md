<p> I note that the ACLU apparently does not have a problem
with the display of American Indian religion in public, funded
with public money.  Terence Jeffrey talks about this in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/terencejeffrey/tj20050302.shtml">Is
the Smithsonian promoting religion?</a>."  This just goes to show
you, it is a battle against Christianity in the public life that we
are engaged in.  The talk of a separation between church and state is
quite simply rhetoric, and it is amazing that religious people have
been accepting this unquestionably for so long.  I find myself once
again tempted to get David Limbaugh's book, <em>Persecution</em>,
but I know it would simply enrage and depress me even further.</p>
