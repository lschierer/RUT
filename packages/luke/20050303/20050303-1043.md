<p> From the sound of "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4314181.stm">US backing
down in abortion row</a>," it seems that the US is backing down
on this pro-life issue.  That is unfortunate, I can only hope that
either the article is wrong, or the analysis that the amendment is
not needed is correct.  However, I find the odds of the latter to
be low, as it would require the previous reports of NGO pressure
to be inaccurate, which would defy common sense.</p>
