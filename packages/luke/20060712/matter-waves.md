Yay for variation in the "constants" of science!!<sup><a title="Scientists question fundamental laws - Space News - MSNBC.com" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13816702/">[1]</a></sup>  On a more sober note, it is apparently by no means sure that thse results are all that repeatable, and thus trustable.  Still, it is nice to see this sort of thing questioned.  <font size="+2">â˜º</font>
