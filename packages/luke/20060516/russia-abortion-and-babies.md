It is ironic in a way that after seemingly winning the cold war, we should be watching Europe follow Russia down the drains, and be looking at following that path ourselves.  Several times now I have posted about the declining population in Europe, which is able to remain afloat only by virtue of immigration.  Today, reading [TheFactIs](http://www.thefactis.org), I learn that in Russia the problem is much the same, except, if possible, even more urgent.[^20121126-1]

There are more babies dieing from abortion in Russia than are being born, 1.7 killed for each live birth.  As a result, for every 10 live births, 16 Russians die.  Imagine, even if 0.7 of those 1.7 babies killed were still to die, then Russia would yet have a growing population.

Certainly a climate of fear and uncertainty likely has something to do with the number of abortions, and thus the mainstream press (as reported by the TheFactIs article) is accidentally right in pointing to this as the cause of declining population.  Yet still, I must protest that a return to socialism, as is apparently advocated by the mainstream press, cannot be the answer.

It certainly is not the case that socialism would solve the employment problem.  While it might create job security for the few who find employment, the example of France and other countries that remain highly socialist show us that there would remain a great deal of unemployment, and thus the fear that the press blames would continue unabated.  The problem here is not truly a problem of security, it is a problem of oportunity.  With the security of private property, a right to the produce of their work, then only security from crime would stand between the Russian people and the solution to their problems.  The small shop, the family farm, the man who happens to have a gift for this or that, these would provide the basis for the economy, these would provide the assurance that tomorrow's needs would be met.
