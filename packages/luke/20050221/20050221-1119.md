Robots and cyborgs and modified muscles in today's news.  "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4275245.stm">Brain-controlled
'robo-arm' hope</a>" talks about controlling a robot
arm from probes embedded in a monkey's brain.  "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3493839.stm">Athlete
cheats seek genetic boost</a>" has a really wrongheaded focus.
Athletes using drugs to build their bodies is nothing new.
Being able to use gene therapy to modify the body is much more
news worthy.  Coupled together, these articles continue along a
series of posts I have made in which we will eventually be forced
to face questions of along the lines of "what constitutes life?"
"What is human?" and "What is intelligence?".
