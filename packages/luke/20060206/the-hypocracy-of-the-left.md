<p>Sometimes I wonder if people <em>practice</em> being logically inconsistent.  Mr. Richard Stallman is my latest example of stupidity.  He claims he supported the war on Afghanistan "because the Taliban were horrible,"<sup><a href="http://www.stallman.org/archives/2005-nov-feb.html#04%20February%202006%20%28Afghanistan%205%20years%20after%29" title="Afghanistan 5 years after">[1]</a></sup> but does <em>not</em> support the war in Iraq, where the Kurds were being killed and gassed by their own ruler.  The hypocrisy is mind boggling.</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Mr. Richard Stallman.
