<p> The Smithsonian's fairly recent exhibit on Ancient Rome
opened my mom's eyes to how much of current science and
history is quite simply speculation.  There is so much we do
not know, and yet they feel free to guess that this or that
ancient writer is biased in one way or another.  They then
declare that reality must have been such and such, based on the
assumed biases of a given writer, and present that as fact!  "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4416757.stm">Flesh on
bones of 'first ape-man'</a>" drips of the same sort of speculation,
though here at least we see <em>some</em> mention of other scientists
criticizing such claims.  Imagine basing your theories on a computer
reconstruction of what you <em>think</em> the skull looked like
before it was distorted by the forces of nature!</p>
