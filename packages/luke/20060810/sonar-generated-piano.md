I am not quite sure how exactly generating piano music from sonar advances volcano erruption prediction, but it does generate some interesting audio files.<sup><a href="http://www.geant2.net/server/show/conWebDoc.2153" title="Research Makes Mount Etna Sing!">[1]</a></sup>  Perhaps the lack of clarity is intentional in the press release, or perhaps its because I did not devote the time to reading it that I should have.  Either way, the audio alone makes the site worth checking out.
