This one was, surprisingly, not really a nightmare.  I get there, the short power-tripping security guard is no longer there.  There is a much larger male security guard.  He has me go through the medal detector and leaves me alone, he assumes I can figure out where to go from there.  This is good, because I <em>do</em> know where to go.  There is an obvious line outside the "Will Call" desks.  I stand in that line for a relatively short line considering the number of people.  After all, this morning it took about half an hour to get from 009 to 016, with far more people working than these two ladies at the two "Will Call" desks.  Anyway, I get up to the front of the line, sign the little slip saying that I have received my passport (and birth certificate, since the lady this morning kept that bit of identifying information), and I was good to go.
