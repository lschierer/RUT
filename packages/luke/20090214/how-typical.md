Boston College's president has made the executive decision to place a crucifix in each of the classrooms on campus.[^200902141]  While it is reported that student responses are generally positive, the faculty is apparently deeply divided and upset.[^200902142]  I suppose the good news is that the younger generation is at least apparently somewhat more open to faith than the older.  The bad news is that the older will be teaching the younger.
