I have been filing bug reports against this for months now.  Well, really only two bug reports so far, but that is because so little has changed in that time.  If you think Gaim development is slow, you should see how closely the macports guys mimic the properties of cold molasses.  This is very frustrating, and an ideal example of why linux continues to be my operating system of choice for my desktop.  Now if only ssh forwarding across the vpn was a little faster&#x2026;
