<p> In science news today:<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news3533.html">Device For Weighing
Individual Molecules</a>" brings us closer to <em>Diamond Age</em><br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4397269.stm">Scan 'shows
if people trust you'</a>" talks about some recent MRI study results.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 20050402-0812:</strong>  Vincas tells me that at least one of these is a April Fools Day thing.  Ahwell, I did generally well yesterday not paying attention to things in the news.</p>
