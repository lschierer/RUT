<p>Sitting in "The Red Carpet Club" since our flight is not until nearly 10pm, and Vincas upgraded our tickets.  It has real seats, which is nice.  Vincas has me carrying a "growler" of beer for him, and my backpack ended up carrying the bottle of champagne that he's giving to his soon to be in-laws.  I find this rather amusing given how little I drink.  We ended up leaving my present for Andrius and his fiance (their wedding present) with Vincas's parents. It will probably reach them late, but I do not think Andrius will mind. Mom and Lauren kept expecting me to be excited.  I am not really, I am going, I want to go for the wedding, but I persisting thinking that this is one of the crazier things I have ever done.  Pranas has been speaking a higher percentage of Lithuanian than normal, it makes me aware that between the native Spanish of Uruguay, and the Lithuanian of the Ciziuni, I really will have jumped into the deep end of the pool with no ability to swim. </p>
