There is or is going to be an article in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science talking about a study in which adult stem cells, which pose no ethical problems, were used to cure type 2 diabetes in mice.<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  This is the sort of thing that *ought* to be incredibly news worthy.  It will be under-reported, however, because of the focus on embryonic stem cells.
