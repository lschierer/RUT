The title of this article says it all: "Liver cells grown from cord blood."<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  While this will not yield organs for liver transplants yet, this will significantly aid drug development and testing, avoiding at least some of the need for human and animal testing.  Without any of the moral problems of embryonic stem cells, this represents yet another example of the false and misleading way in which the debate is being presented in this country.  We are not banning stem cell research.  We are preventing *people* from being used, *killed*, as research material.
