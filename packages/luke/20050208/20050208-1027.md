Michael Behe, author of <em>Darwin's Black Box</em>, authored "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/opinion/07behe.html?oref=login">Design
for Living</a>" in the New York Times.  I'm rather amazed they
printed it, even in the opinion section.  In it, he clearly and
insightfully explains what "Intelligent Design" is and isn't.
He is a very good author, his book was one of the first I read on
being introduced to the concept, along with some of his and Phillip
Johnson's papers available at <a href="http://www.arn.org/">ARN</a>.
My favorite quote from this piece is

<blockquote>Still, some critics claim that science by definition
can't accept design, while others argue that science should keep
looking for another explanation in case one is out there. But we
can't settle questions about reality with definitions, nor does it
seem useful to search relentlessly for a non-design explanation of
Mount Rushmore.</blockquote>
