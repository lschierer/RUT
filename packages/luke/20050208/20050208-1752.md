I'm now sporting an RSS 2.0 feed that passes the validator at <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/">http://rss.scripting.com/</a>,
which is the one recommended by <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss</a>,
the site that I used as a source for the RSS specification.  If you
try to view it in a browser, you don't get the nicely formatted
version, because the .php version is generated <em>on request</em>.
I am very proud of my self ;-).  There is an all nicely formatted
version at <a href="./rss.xml">rss.xml</a>, but that one is done
by cron job, and only updated once an hour.  Still, I'm all excited
that I was able to do this fairly easily!
