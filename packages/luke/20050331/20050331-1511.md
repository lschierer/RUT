<p> Today, as Mrs. Schiavo died, Boundless posted "<a href="http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0001064.cfm">If
I End Up Like Terri: An Open Letter to My Wife</a>."  As Sister
Chabel (spelling) at Gift of Peace house in D.C. said, She is in
heaven now, we need to pray for her husband, her family, and all
those involved in this mess.  We also need to pray for each other,
that we will survive the turmoil to come, and that we will be taken
better care of if some tragedy reduces us to such a state.</p>
