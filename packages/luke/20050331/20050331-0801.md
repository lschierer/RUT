<p> I find it rather ironic that I posted
about cyborgs only yesterday considering <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4396387.stm">this
BBC article</a>.  Scientists have now developed a way to
implant a computer chip such that the brain can control it,
it can read some "brain waves," and let you control electrical
devices.  Examples include TV power, channel, and volume.
They hope to extend this to allow paralyzed to move again.  "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1448140,00.html">Meet
the mind readers</a>" goes into further details on this idea,
apparently there have been some successes along these lines.</p>
