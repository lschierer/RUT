Yesterday the air conditioning service guy recharged the freon in the air handler here at the office.  Today for the first time in *MONTHS*, it is *cold* here at the office.  At least upstairs.  There is a nine degree difference between up here and down by the thermostat (colder up here) and another nine degree difference when you go into the server room.
