Overall a very good weekend.  The family made it up (and down) safely, and is or has headed back, equally safely.  Papa was uber surprised when he arrived at Maggiano's and found a birthday party in place of a graduation party.  We had 50 people there, including a number of people he has not seen in a great many years.  Michael's graduation also went well, despite the rain.  As per his request, we had a barbecue, moving the grill into the garage, but otherwise going more or less as planned.  

On the downside, Lauren missed much of the weekend's activities, not feeling well. <font size="+3">&#x2639;</font>
