<blockquote markdown="1">A U.S. Department of Education report, in compliance with the 2002 “No Child Left Behind” act, found that up to 10% of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers.[^200802071]</blockquote>

We, as a culture, are obsessed with abuse in the Church.  It *is* a huge scandal, one that could have and should have been handled better by our bishops.  However, to focus so exclusively on that, and to ignore the far greater problems we have in this society, is to do a disservice to our children.  More, it is morally negligent and dishonest.
