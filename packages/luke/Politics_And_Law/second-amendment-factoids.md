Apparently I have almost never written here about the Second Amendment.  That
somewhat surprises me. I was looking at TownHall's "C-log" today, and found 
[this gem][tha1].[^1] It provides facts and figures on the reality of gun
control and concealed carry permits.  Worth taking note of.

"[The 'Gun Problem'][tha2]" by Mr. Mark Alexander points out some useful
statistics for use in discussions with people where guns are banned.[^2]
