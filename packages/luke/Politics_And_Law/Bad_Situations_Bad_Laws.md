The CS Monitor has an article today talking about the state
of "second wives" in France.[^1] Apparently France only very
recently outlawed polygamy, and a number of African men have
come to France bringing multiple "wives" and the children of both
"wives."  The article highlights the problems that come from lack
of enforcement since the 1993 outlawing, and the unwillingness of
the government to deal with those polygamous families it allowed in
before outlawing polygamy.  While the outlawing of polygamy is both
rational and moral, it is immoral to treat these women as somehow
neither married nor single and thus allow them to fall through the
cracks.  Naturally, they cannot be married as a marriage is between
one man and one woman, so they must be single with children, and
should be legally so treated.  Worse, I am sure this sort of thing
will be used by liberals world-wide to try to pressure France to
repeal the law.  This would be an unmitigated disaster, with the
marriage under attack from so many other angles as well.
