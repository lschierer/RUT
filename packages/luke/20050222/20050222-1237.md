"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-21-2005/20050221004505_16.html">'Minutemen'
to Patrol Arizona Border</a>" talks about some people deciding
to take on the problem of illegal immigration.  This seems a less
severe case of citizens taking matters into their own hands than
one I heard about a while back in the state &amp; national parks
out west.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1154/2-22-2005/20050222050007_11.html">Supreme
Court to Hear Eminent Domain Case</a>" talks about Connecticut
citizens fighting to keep their homes.<br  /><br  />

I'm not sure what I think of either of these.  I see the legitimacy
of the state in creating zoning laws and changing them as the needs
of the community change.  I can also see where this could be abused.
I understand citizens being frustrated with federal failure
year after year; I read in history the problems of vigilantes.
What is right?  What is best?  These are hard questions.
