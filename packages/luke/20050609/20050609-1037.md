Since when is recess in grade school "Instructional time?"
That is the pitiful excuse that Karns Elementary School in Knoxville
Tennessee is using to bar a 10 year old kid from reading the Bible
during recess with a few other students.[^1] Naturally they have
been served with a federal lawsuit claiming they are restricting
his freedom of religion.
