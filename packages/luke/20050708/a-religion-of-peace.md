<p>Is Islam a religion of peace? Or not?  At least some think that it is not, at least not as practiced by terrorists.  And they think that this militant (only?) form of Islam should be relevant to a trial.<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1120727114514">[1]</a> I cannot say I blame the prosecutor here.  But how would I feel if it were Catholicism being used as evidence?  Well, it was in the early centuries, the difference there being that our true beliefs were not understood by those supposing our religion to be evidence. So I return to my original question, is Islam best represented by the terrorist, does the terrorist differ from the "average" Muslim only in his willingness to follow through on the implications of his doctrine?  Or not?</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Blum, Vanessa.  "Putting Islam on the Stand" Legal Times via Law.com.  2005-07-08 http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1120727114514 </font>
