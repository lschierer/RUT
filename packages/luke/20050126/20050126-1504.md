I've more or less been slowly writing this all day today,
though the size of it does not reflect that.  *shrugs*
Ah-well.

There is a man in
Florida who has some incredible guts, whatever his other faults.
[This story](http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/features/1120/1-26-2005/20050126053003_40.html) talks about a man who full-page newspaper ad in an
attempt to contact his wife and save his Marriage.  Whatever
his faults, I think it must have taken great courage to use so
public a method to reach her.  I hope things work out.

In Delaware, a "life" sentence now means 45 years.[^20050126-1]  Lovely.  People argue
against the death penalty saying that in the modern era, it is
possible to keep society safe without it.  I tend to agree, but
things like this make me wonder if that is true.

I hate it when users get ideas about how easy something is to implement.
I hate it even more when they think they can dictate priorities.
Why can people not grasp that in an open source project, only the
developers' priorities matter?
