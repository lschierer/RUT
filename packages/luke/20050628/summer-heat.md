<p>Europe is apparently experiencing unusually high temperatures.  According to the one article I read,<a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/050627/1/3t6jd.html">[1]</a> it seems to range, with latitude, from the low 90s to around 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  This compared to Texas, which often shows in the 100-110 degree range in the summers.  Yes, if this is unusual, then the lack of air conditioning, and more, the lack of awareness of how to handle such heat, can, and apparently two years ago, did, prove catastrophic.  But the point of real interest here is the differences in outlook and in standard of living that this shows. Spain feels the need for a national warning system.  The United States simply announces the temperature of the morning weather. Germans' expect a day off, the United States sees businesses installing air conditioning and fans.  France passes more laws, because without them apparently people would not take care of themselves.</p>  <p>This last exposes the standard of living differences.  France is requiring <em>one</em> air conditioned room for the elderly. For some &lt;sarcasm&gt;odd&lt;/sarcasm&gt; reason I do not think this is because that is all that is strictly needed.  I think it is because its sufficient and more would be too expensive to expect. This, wide spread panic over something Texas deals with every summer, from the society we are supposed to emulate.</p>   <font size="-2"> [1] "Heat wave alert as southern Europe bakes" http://sg.news.yahoo.com/050627/1/3t6jd.html </font>
