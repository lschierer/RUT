<blockquote markdown="1">As results were tallied, McCain led with 345 delegates, to 129 for Romney and 115 for Huckabee. It takes 1,191 to win the nomination at this summer's convention in St. Paul, Minn.[^200802061]</blockquote>

This surprised me.  I had not realized that Mr. Huckabee was doing so well.  Perhaps he was not, going into "Super Tuesday."  Either way, he is now very nearly in second place for the nomination, and it is no wonder that he has not dropped out yet.  

I do not really expect that he might win.  I am watching Senator McCain in the news.  He has received endorsements from a number of real pro-life advocates, such as Senator Brownback.  I wonder if these intelligent men are right to trust him, and I wrong to distrust him, or if I am in the right, and they self-deluded.

I hope we have the opportunity to find out, but I wish even more strongly that I did not need to wonder.
