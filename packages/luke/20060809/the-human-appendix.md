The other day, Lauren mentioned to me that her anatomy professor was teaching the class that the appendix is a functionless organ.&nbsp; This view, that it is a vestigal organ, a remnant of evolution, is certainly a common one.&nbsp; There is, however, no real reason to believe it.&nbsp; What follows is a collection of articles I have found, either directly via google search, or indirectly via the references in other articles (some of which are here).
