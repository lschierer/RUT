I would love to quote [this](http://ncregister.com/site/article/3788/ "Adolescent Ardor")[^200709071] in full.  The <i>Register</i>'s copyright does not permit that though, so I can only highly recommend you read this very short article.  Hopefully this is not one of the ones that requires you have a subscription to reach.  In short, in case it is, *MTV* conducted a survey of its demographic group.  It found that "75% of survey participants said God or a higher power has some impact on their happiness"[^200709072]  and that 80% of those who place religion or spirituality first in their life report being happy.[^200709073]
