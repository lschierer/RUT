The fan on the power supply for my desktop computer died Monday at some point.  Fortunately I got home Monday night.  The computer was black-screened, and very hot to the touch.  I hope it did not roast itself to death, but until I get a new power supply in, I cannot test.  This is a significant concern, because I had been hoping to avoid significant computer expenses for a while.
