Former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson has joined the list of candidates that I would have a hard time justifying voting for.[^200711072]  I am not sure that I can vote for a pro-choice republican, even as a vote against the democratic candidate who would be worse.  I suspect it might be better, in the long run, if I were to vote instead for some 3rd party to help remind the republicans that they need "values voters" if they want to win elections.
