<p>In the news today is a ruling on a death penalty case in which Justice Alito voted to stay an execution pending more arguments before the appeals court.<sup><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1138874710211&amp;rss=newswire" title="Alito Splits Ranks With Conservatives in Missouri Death Penalty Case">{1]</a></sup> This is news because Justice Alito did not vote with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas. The death penalty certainly <em>can</em> be just and right. It <em>is</em> within the powers of the State, if exercised appropriately.  The key though is "exercised appropriately," which translates to "only when we cannot otherwise protect society." I doubt we are in such straights anywhere near as often as we sentence to death.  And so I can understand Alito's vote.  Let us pray that he votes pro-life not only on this issue but on all.</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Ms. Gina Holland.
