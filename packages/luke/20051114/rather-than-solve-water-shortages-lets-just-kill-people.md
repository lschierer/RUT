<p>I find it interesting that the (apparently from his blog) very liberal Richard Stallman would rather the violence done to women and the abortion(murder) of children in China as part of their one child policy<sup><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050914-1417/the-deplorable-state-of-china" title="the deplorable state of China">[1]</a></sup> than work for greater investment in finding alternative water sources.<sup><a href="http://www.stallman.org/archives/2005-sep-dec.html#12%20November%202005%20%28Secret%20plot%20with%20the%20World%20Bank%29" title="Secret plot with the World Bank">[2]</a></sup> Given 7 ocean's worth of salt water, how can it be an "unsolvable" problem?  Rather, this is a problem of being unwilling to commit to research and allowing companies the profit necessary to make that research viable. It <em>may</em> also be a function of greed, and not being willing to fund the further research to bring the price per gallon down to an affordable level.  I doubt that however, as one would think that the larger market would attract even if charity failed to assist.</p>  <font size="-2"><ol><li> Mr. Luke Schierer.
