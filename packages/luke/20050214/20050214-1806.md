"<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/dg20050212.shtml">Raising
pit bull children</a>" is amusing.  It is an extended analogy with
a great deal of truth to it, but I can't help but find the repeated
references to put bulls funny.  Seriously though, he has a point,
where are children supposed to learn to stand up for their beliefs if
not from their parents?  We need to assert that there is such a thing
as absolute truth.  We need to hold our selves accountable to it.
We need to hold our society accountable as well, and work to change
what doesn't stand up.  This last is something I fail at I fear.
