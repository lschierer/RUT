yay for a recent meme in the community that generates a plethora of quotable quotes. &#x263a;  Two more for the collection:

"If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them." &mdash;George Orwell

"All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value." &mdash;Carl Sagan

Proof, if any were needed (I have a quote from Freud in my collection after all), that even those I tend to disagree with can produce a pearl of wisdom now and then.
