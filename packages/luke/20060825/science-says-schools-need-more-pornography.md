The Mexican government has proposed new text books for biology.  They are <i>quite</i> graphic.  They reportedly contain an explicet statement that homosexuality and masturbation are "acceptable" behaviors.  They also apparently encourage students to download pornography.<sup><a href="http://www.cathnews.com/news/608/141.php" title="Mexican bishops turn heat on graphic sex education textbooks">[1]</a></sup>  This is bad enough in and of itself; I would be up in arms anyway, simply for the fact that a <i>biology</i> textbook is daring to make a <i>moral</i> judgement.  There is, however, more.

In defense of this textbook, which is facing opposition from both the Church and some parents' groups, the Mexican Health Secretary states that "at the end of the day, the government's public policies should be based on scientific evidence."<sup><a href="http://www.cathnews.com/news/608/141.php" title="Mexican bishops turn heat on graphic sex education textbooks">[2]</a></sup>  Now, mind you, a government could do far worse than to follow this policy, even though it can lead to abominations.  That really misses the point though.  Since when is there "scientific evidence" that homosexuality is an "acceptable" behavior?  When did the feild of ethics start being a branch of science?  Can I get a bachelors of science in it from <i>any</i> reputable university?  Are there scholarly journals in this scientific field?  Who is researching it?  How are they conducting their experiments?  For that matter, what experements would one perform to determine the acceptability of such behavior?  <b><i>How is this scienceâ€½</i></b>

Returning for a minute here, why should government blindly follow science?  Certainly, we would end up in a ludicrous position if government ignored science, but do we really want to let scientists rule us?  There is some research, such as that done by some Nazi scientists on the Jews in the concentration camps, that simply should not happen.  It is a function of government to <i>restrain</i> science into morally acceptable channels.  If government starts simply following science, it will quickly lead to moral anarchy, and from there to civil anarchy.
