<p>Protecting athletes from being held back, suspended, and
expelled for lack of academic performance is plaguing even some
of our Catholic schools.  This really serves no one any good, as
they will not (likely) be in sports for the rest of their lives.
The number of people getting passed along in grade school and
high school is significantly higher than the number of people
in professional sports after all, and even the professional
sports athletes typically retire young.  Which brings me to <a href="http://www.accessnorthga.com/news/ap_newfullstory.asp?ID=60362">the
story of a teacher being fired for refusing to change a grade</a>.
One of his students appeared to be asleep in class.  The teacher,
no doubt frustrated by the lack of effort that the student was
putting into the class, lowered his grade, and was fired (after
refusing to restore it).  Tell me, what has this student learned?
That he can do whatever in class and it will not matter.  How does
this prepare him for the real world out there, beyond the school
doors, where he will have to make a living, and support himself
and perhaps a family?  It does not prepare him; it prepares him
only for a life on welfare.</p>
