"Americans are finally beginning to recognize the fatal self-interest at the heart of Planned Parenthood, and the essential lie on which it’s built: While it pretends to be neutral on life and death questions, it only makes big money when large numbers of babies die."[^200708031] &mdash;Alan Sears

[^200708031]: Mr. Alan Sears.  "Hanging on … But Not for Dear Life"  National Catholic Register 2007-07-31, 2007/08/05-11 Issue.  <http://ncregister.com/site/article/3297 />
