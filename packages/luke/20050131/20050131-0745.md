William brought <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/080bysuf.asp?pg=1">this
article</a> to my attention.  I'd heard about this guy's research
from other places, and it really doesn't surprise me.  Like most
(good) work from an economist, this conforms to the "it makes sense
once you say it" rule.  This article has more detail than the one I
had seen, and I find the fact that it was sent to me significant,
the research in question is more noteworthy than I had originally
thought.  It appears there is a <em>chance</em> that this will not
be ignored.<br  /><br  />

<a href="http://michellemalkin.com">Michelle Malkin</a> <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001374.htm">writes</a>
about some of the effects of Europe's burgeoning Muslim population.
Mostly consisting of quotes from other works, this is a good
introduction for those who think that Muslims will assimilate into
their host cultures.
