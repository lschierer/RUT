In Germany prostitution is legal.  Not only legal, it is a "normal,"
tax paying industry which has access to official databases of job
seekers.  Yes, the scum who run such things can call you up if they
like the sound of your resume and try to get you to work for them.
Now Germany is also in quite a fix because it is a welfare state.
And in trying to get a handle on that, it has decided that if
you are out of work for more than a year, and you turn down a
job offer, you can have your welfare benefits cut.  How does
this relate?  Some scumbag offers you a job as a prostitute,
you turn him down, now all of a sudden you don't get welfare.
Now, I'm against welfare in general and in principle, but in the
presence of a welfare state, with its high taxes, people are hard
pressed to fund private/religious social services.  Add into the
mix Germany's ever increasing atheist populations (well, its Muslim
population is probably increasing faster, but outside of that),
and you have a situation that is worse than welfare: you have
women being forced into prostitution by the state.  Lovely.  See <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/01/30/wgerm30.xml">this
telegraph.co.uk article</a> for documentation of this outrage.
