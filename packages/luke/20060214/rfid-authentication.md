<p><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/20050504-1118/20050504-1118" title="20050504-1118">It has been a while<sup>[1]</sup></a> since I last wrote about RFID.  The most recent article I have read on the subject is substantially more of a concern than the others that show up in the recent history if you search "Random Unfinished Thoughts."<sup><a href="https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/index.php?s=RFID" title="Results of such a search">[2]</a></sup> This is because I now read about tagging <em>people</em>, not <em>products</em> or even <em>documents</em>.<sup><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/ec414700-9bf4-11da-8baa-0000779e2340.html" title="US group implants electronic tags in workers">[3]</a></sup> This takes the idea of biometric authentication to a new and highly disturbing level.  Notably, it combines the worst aspects of biometrics' hard-to-deny with RFID's easy-to-covertly-read. Thus if it ever does prove forgable, as is rather likely, as it would be a purely technical matter of reverse engineering the chip inside, you will have a particularly nasty sort of identity theft.</p>  <p>The pluses for those wishing to secure facilities and monitor workers are as considerable as the risks are, so I expect that this sort of monitoring will become more prevalent.</p>  <ol><font size="-2"><li><font size="-2">Mr. Luke Schierer.
