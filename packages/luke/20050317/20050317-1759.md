<p> So Senate Democrats are reluctant to
pass a bill to move the Terry Schiavo case into Federal court.  "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/national/17cnd-schiavo.html?ei=5088&en=ccf532a95e456067&ex=1268715600&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=">Debate
Over Brain-Damaged Woman's Fate Shifts to Congress</a>" unfortunately
requires NYTimes registration, but provides the only article on
this that I currently see.  The House passed a bill that applies
not only to this case, but to the class of cases, and apparently
the Senate doesn't much like that.  Further, they are blocking a
measure to just apply to this one, though there seems to be some
home they will agree on it.  Unfortunately, that one in turn, will
have trouble in the House, or so it says.  Not sure what I think
of this.  I think I am leaning towards wishing they would vote for
it solely because I am frustrated with the inability of the Florida
government to make any headway in protecting her life.</p>
