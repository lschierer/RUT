<p> In science news today, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4357613.stm">Lab fireball
'may be black hole'</a>" is rather interesting.  Doesn't sound
quite the same to me, but I know that I do not know enough to
really be evaluating such an article, even, perhaps especially,
the undetailed version that the BBC offers.</p>
