<p>A recent report makes "news" of the fact that women are in general, and consistently, capable of less exercise than men.  Both the Washington Post<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/03/AR2005080301635_pf.html">[1]</a>, and the New York Times<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/04/health/04exercise.html?pagewanted=print">[2]</a> report on this story, though interestingly, the Post devotes nearly three times as much space to it.  The difference they have found is not huge, a 50 year old woman reaching 8.2 "metabolic equivalents" (METs), and a 50 year old man reaching 9.2 METs, but apparently this difference grows with age.  Just a little more proof that men and women are not, as we are told, interchangeable.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Nano, Stephanie.
