Two related doses of common sense are available in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4236229.stm"> Babies
'overfed on formula milk'</a>.  First, some study has looked at
formula fed babies versus breast fed babies, and found that the
growth tables, based nearly exclusively on formula fed babies,
was wrong, it was expecting too much growth.  This in turn caused
some doctors to recommend mothers supplement breast feeding with
formula, or not breast feed at all.  Dr Mecedes de Onis comes out
with the oh so surprising statement that "Breast fed infants are the
biological norm."  How could it be otherwise?  Without getting into
whether or not parents should choose one or the other, after all,
its nice for the moms to let the dads do some of the night feeding,
surely we can realize that whether you believe in God or evolution,
both would tend towards that "discovery."<br  /><br  />

The second item of "news" is that your energy needs vary with your
exercise level, and thus a one-size-fits-all recommendation of
2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men is too high for some
people and too low for others.  Wow, I never would have guessed.
