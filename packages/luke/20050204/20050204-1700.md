In his typical way, Walter Williams has given one of
the best refutations of the whole mess surrounding the
president of Harvard saying that there may be innate
differences between men and women that may account
for the discrepancy in their math and science scores.  In "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20050202.shtml">Anti-intellectualism
among the academic elite</a>," he compares this to the disparities
that follow race lines in health and athletics; how sickle cell
anemia occurs mostly in black people, Tay-Sachs disease mostly in
easter European Jews.  He goes on to use swimming and running in
the Olympics to hammer home his point.  Really people, do we need
to let politics and ideology get in the way of realizing the truth
that people are <em>different</em> and that there is nothing wrong
with that, it doesn't take away from their humanity or dignity,
we just need to accept it, adjust to it, and move on.
