While it is interesting to see a theory get challenged, in this
case the solar system formation theory that we all learned in grade
school or high school, there is something even more interesting in
"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4205227.stm">
Meteorite gives clues to Sun birth</a>."  What strikes me as more
interesting is that even when they are challenging a theory, they
are utterly certain that they know what's going on.<br  />

Also in science today, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4235979.stm">
Life flourishes at crushing depth</a>" documents the discovery of
life at previously unexplored depths.  This reminds me of some of
Dr. Thomas Gold's writings.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1403780,00.html?gusrc=rss">
Sex and the single robot</a>" is really disturbing.  Robots with
personalities and emotions?  The mind boggles.  This will decidedly
blur the distinction between what is life and what is not.
Asimov's robot stories come to mind.<br  /><br  />

Next, "<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,66487,00.html">Scientists
Find Missing Matter</a>" reports on the discovery of at least some
of the "dark matter" that has been theorized for ages.  Found it
by noticing that some intergalactic cloud was absorbing more than
it should.  Neat.<br  /><br  />

Taking organ doning to the next logical level, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4236873.stm"> Living donor
diabetes transplant</a>" reports on progress towards transplanting
<em>cells</em>, in this case insulin producing cells to treat Type
1 diabetes.
