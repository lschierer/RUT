<p> Using a new way to reveal ink, scientists are now
able to access the text of some old papyrus documents.
According to "<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/story.jsp?story=630166"">
Eureka! Extraordinary discovery unlocks secrets of the ancients</a>,"
some of the writings of Sophocles, Euripides and Hesiod have been
revealed, and they think that others yet to be looked at may
"include works by Ovid and Aeschylus, plus a series of
Christian gospels which have been lost for up to 2,000 years."</p>
