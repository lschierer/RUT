<p>Talking about the sexualization of society in general, Mr. Ben Shapiro calls mine the "Porn Generation."[1] Everyone knows that filth is readily available on the Internet.  Anyone with an email address likely sees more of it than they want to.  But to focus on the Internet really is to miss the bulk of what is going on in our culture.  When you see the lawsuits that the ACLU starts, and as you watch the push for homosexual "marriages" the picture starts to become clearer though.  Pervasive in many of the television shows (Mr. Shapiro uses "Friends" as an example), is the idea that you can have sex without cost or risk, and that promiscuity is normal and acceptable.  The same message is sent as we teach ever younger grade schoolers about condoms and sex.  The result is also ever clearer: we now have grade schoolers having sex parties.[2]</p>

<p>But not only are we funding sex ed for children, we are also funding sex itself.[3] No doubt those who use Viagra are thankful for it, but surely this is something more like cosmetic surgery than it is like an antibiotic.  This goes back to the point Mr. Walter Williams was making (see my previous post), when we socialize things, we end up paying for things we never otherwise would.  Here though, it goes far beyond seat belts.  Here we are paying for the idea that sex is a need, and, implicitly, that it is not controlled by the will any more than any other bodily function.  This reveals the root of the problem: we have mentally divorced sex from marriage and thus from procreation.  Once we did that, we opened the door, just as Pope Paul VI predicted, to a whole host of other problems.</p>
