Once Lauren is able to print off the contract and initial it as needed, we will have a ratified contract on a condo.  I am at once very excited and very nervous.  This is far and away the biggest purchase I/we have ever made.

God works in mysterious ways.  If either of the first two sellers had accepted any of the offers/counter offers we submitted to them, we would have ended up paying nearly the same amount for smaller places, and in the case of the short-sale place, one that needed more work.  

Next step is the home inspection.  Hopefully that will go well.
