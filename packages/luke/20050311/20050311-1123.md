<p> So <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2004/gut.htm">here</a>
is an interesting article, "It's the gut, stupid!" from <em>Infection
&amp; Immunity</em>: 73(1), January 2005.  Researchers reporting
in this article have linked allergies to oddness in the bacteria
content of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Apparently taking lots
of antibiotics will wipe out your normal bacteria.  And apparently a
somewhat different mix is what grows back, at least for a short time.
As I have pointed out in the past, the appendix, possibly along with
other parts of the GI tract, is responsible for exposing the immune
system to foreign material, to help "teach" it what is harmful.
So with your GI tract all weirded out by the antibiotics, they can
make mice far more likely to develop allergies.  This is interesting
on a personal note because I was taking enough anti-biotics as a
child, due to frequent (approximately one a month) sinus infections,
to become immune to some of them.  Perhaps this is why I'm allergic
to dust, dogs, and pollen?  It boggles the mind.</p>
