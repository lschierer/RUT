So I was an idiot, and after my polygraph back in June, I left my passport in my pants pocket.  Yes, I was not really thinking very well (to the extent of nearly getting lost on the way home), but still.  Naturally, Murphy trying his hardest, I did not realize this until last night: giving me less than a week before I need it.

While the passport is still legible, its incredibly crinkled and bent, the cloth cover is no longer attached, and appears to have shrunk slightly (having gone through the dryer as well).  So I would say it is very much in the "damaged passport" category.  What do you do when you have 5 days to get a new passport?

Apparently, similar things happen to other people as well.  For nearly double the normal amount in fees, I will come out of an appointment at the regional passport office with a same-day passport.  Score: Divine Providence 1, Murphy 0 (so far, I am keeping my fingers crossed and still very much praying that nothing further goes wrong).
