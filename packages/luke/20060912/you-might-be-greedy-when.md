You cut back production because, even though your profits are still very high, they are no longer record breaking.<sup><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/51ec2e78-40da-11db-827f-0000779e2340.html" title="Opec concerned over falling oil prices">[1]</a></sup>  Even worse, they are talking about it being a problem if oil were to drop to or below $50/barrel.  If $67/barrel translates to gas prices at $2.70/gallon, then OPEC needs some serious revision in their view of reality.  Though I remain unsure how much of that is OPEC and how much the gas companies when I see that Iowa has gas prices as low as <em>$2.05</em>/gallon.<sup><a href="http://www.iowastategasprices.com/" title="IowaStateGasPrices.com">[2]</a></sup>  Either way, it is totally insane.
