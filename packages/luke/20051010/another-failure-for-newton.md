<p>Apparently we have been neglecting to fully use the tools Einstein gave us in the form of General Relativity and Special Relativity.  In our quest for quantum mechanics, we have overlooked the fact that General Relativity can explain away the need for dark matter in at least some situations.<sup><a href="http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/45/8/8">[1]</a></sup> Note the speculation on <em>why</em> it took so long to realize this is mine.  The article merely talks about the realization itself.</p>  <font size="-2"> <ol> <li>Mr.(Dr.?) Steve Reucroft and Mr.(Dr.?) John Swain, Northeastern University.
