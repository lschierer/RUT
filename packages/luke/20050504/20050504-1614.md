<p> I have long distrusted the development of
the European Union.  Phyllis Schlafly seconds and
provides reasoning behind my instinctual distrust in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/ps20050502.shtml">European
Union a model for the demise of democracy</a>."  She is hardly
unbiased, but then who is?  It is a disturbing picture she paints,
and with the glimpses into the workings of the European Union that
the software patent fight over there have given, even paying as
little attention to it as I ended up doing, I am tending to believe
she is likely accurate.</p>
