<p> "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4509403.stm">Robots
to help out blind shoppers</a>" talks about using a robot with
a laser range finder and a RFID reader to help blind shoppers.
They will be taking an unusual approach it seems, using RFID to
mark <em>regions</em> of the store, rather than <em>specific
products</em>.  This is much less worrisome to me as someone
concerned about privacy from corporations.  However, the spurt of
robot developments does bring up the timeliness of Having Asimov's
"I, Robot" in theaters so recently.  This is particularly on my
mind since I just now saw it for the first time, it finally having
reached the weekly rental section in Block Busters.</p>
