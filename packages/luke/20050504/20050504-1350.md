<p> Have I mentioned that I like the movie "The Incredibles"?
I do. Quite a bit, and not just for the attack on political
correctness that is quite explicit in its plot.  Paul D. Gallagher <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GuestColumns/Gallagher20050501.shtml">writes</a>
about why he likes it, expressing the same ideas I would.  We need
more movies like this. <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font></p>
