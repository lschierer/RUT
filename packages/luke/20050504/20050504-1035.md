<p> Legal news run down:</p>

<ul> <li>"<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050504/D89S4EJO0.html">Texas
Lawmakers OK Cheerleading Ban</a>" Of note: one, the common sense
approach of "any married adult knows it when they see it," and two,
if you waited to do good things until the "big" issues were all
addressed, you would make far less net progress.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/andrews/pl/gun/20050503/20050503small.html">Foreign
Court Gun Conviction Doesn't Bar U.S. Ownership, Supreme Court
Says</a>" "any court" only refers to US courts.  This is apparently
common sense, because "Congress generally legislates with domestic
concerns in mind."  But it is okay to look at other countries when
we dislike what a domestic view would lead to.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/d93a000efc020a9d.html">Democrats
Sue Over Indiana Voter ID Law</a>" Its too much to prove you aren't
dead, and are who you say you are.  Now its debatable that we should
have to ID for the polls at all perhaps, but as long as you have
to give your name and address, giving a photo with that name is
not a legitimate cause for concern.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115111117689">Attorney
Who Leaked Secret FBI Tape to Reporter Charged With Contempt,
Perjury</a>" this guy obviously does not have the right friends,
if he knew the Clintons, then he would not be charged, just like
that State department official was not charged.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1115111120593">Lawyers
Seek Pass From Privacy Law</a>" lawyers do not want to follow a
law that is just fine for the rest of us apparently.  So much for
"equal protection."</li>

</ul>
