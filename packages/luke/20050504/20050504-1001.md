<p> There is just one thing about "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/05-03-2005/6003001da897b509.html">Defense:
England Oxygen-Deprived at Birth</a>" that I want to comment on.
It mentions "a psychologist testifying that the reservist was
oxygen-deprived at birth, speech impaired and had trouble learning
to read."  A <strong><em>psychologist</em></strong> is testifying
on this&#x203d; His area of expertise is <em>what</em> now&#x203d;
Reading further, perhaps he is simply testifying to the fact that
he has been aware of this diagnosis for years.  Either way, it is
evidence of the disturbing trend to question the priest but trust
the psychologist.  I fail to grasp what the material difference is,
except, of course, that you have had a chance to know what sort of
person the priest is from his homilies, but you know nothing about
the psychologist except possibly a recommendation.</p>
