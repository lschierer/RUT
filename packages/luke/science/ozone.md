In 2005, I noted that the sun plays a role in the creation of or destruction of the ozone layer.[^20121029-1]  This role was not expected by our leading scientists, and thus the change in rate of the destuction was not anticipated.

Now, we see the second smallest ozone hole in 20 years.[^20121029-2]  We are not, however, allowed to think this a positive sign.  Nor may we consider any causes other than CFCs.  Apparently, despite past surprises, we *know* that any signs of recovery cannot happen for at least another decade.
