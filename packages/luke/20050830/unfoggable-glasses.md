<p>In much lighter news, glasses might get somewhat easier to wear thanks to some research funded by the Defense Department.<a href="http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=1312">[1]</a> It seems they have developed some combination of glass and silica that does not fog!  Beyond the military and automotive uses that the article describes, just think about having a pair of glasses with this! No more fogging when you move from air conditioning to not. Less trouble in the rain, when raindrops normally make it hard to see through glasses.  This would really really rock.  Oh, and as a side note, the article is right that it would be nice for cars.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] azonano.com "Unique Polymer Coating - Made of Silica Nanoparticles Eliminates Fogging" azonano.com Nanotechnology News (online) 2005-08-29. http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=1312  </font>
