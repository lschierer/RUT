<p> Ben Shapiro's article, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/bs20050309.shtml">The
radical homosexual agenda and the destruction of standards</a>,"
provides a powerful critique of the flaws in the concept of
"tolerance."  They basically boil down to the fact that the
immoral and amoral are never satisfied.  They keep reaching new
lows, and insisting we accept those.  They keep insisting that I
not only allow their behavior, but accept it as normal, as good,
when I believe it harmful and bad.  They demand I accept them and
their beliefs, but do not accept me or mine.</p>

<p>Actively homosexual people should not be discriminated against.
Well and good.  We can agree on that.  But their behavior is
<em>not</em> normal.  It is <em>not</em> healthy.  It is much
like smoking, a poison that will kill them given time.  Kill them
spiritually if not physically, and often enough both.</p>

<p>I am not discriminating against them when I deny them the
ability to marry another of the same sex.  I am recognizing the
reality of marriage.  It simply is not <em>possible</em> for a
"marriage" between two people to be, in fact, a marriage.  I am
not discriminating against them, nor against single parents, when I
say that ideally a child is raised by a mother and a father who are
married and who have been married to no one else.  People fail, they
are human, and so some couples end up divorced, and surely those
families, headed by single mothers and single fathers, need our
prayers, assistance, and support.  But the <em>ideal</em> remains:
<em>ideally</em> the family would not break down; <em>ideally</em>
children would not be abused by parents; <em>ideally</em> they would
not be abused at all.  <em>Ideally</em> they will be raised by a
loving father and a loving mother who teach them right judgment,
good morals, a strong faith, and a strong work ethic.  And society
would be better for it.</p>
