rejects transfer of monument, property</a>" reports that atheists
have struck again against Christianity in the public sphere.
This time, regrettably, more successfully.  This case seems,
to me, very similar to the pair currently in the US Supreme
Court.  David Limbaugh alerted me to this article in his post, "<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/san_diego_city.html">San
Diego City Council Orders Cross Removed</a>."  As he says, I highly
doubt our founding fathers would have intended any such thing.</p>
