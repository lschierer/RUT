<p> Ann Coulter looks at some of the numbers,
and lack there of, involving female cops in "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/ac20050317.shtml">Freeze!
I just had my nails done!</a>."  Chris once asked me a question
about what sort of cop I would be more afraid of, we came to the
same conclusion her numbers do: the female cop is scarier, because
she is more likely to shoot you, being unable to apply what Ann
Coulter calls "intermediate force."</p>
