<p>Everyone with any sense knows that the Constitution says nothing
about funding the National Institutes of Health, the Department of
Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, Social Security,
Medicare/Medicaid, so on.  The Federal Government is, by any sane
reading of the constitution (I.E. not insanely extending "necessary
and proper"), incredibly limited in scope.  So since the electorate
demonstrably does not care, why does Terence Jeffrey think that
merely pointing the fact of unconstitutional spending once again
will get anyone upset, inform anyone of anything new, or otherwise
be worth writing?[1]</p>
