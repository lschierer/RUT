<p>Most people will not question the idea that black families earn
less, on average, than white ones.  Democrats use this to advance
the idea that discrimination still exists.  Star Parker, herself a
black woman (to defuse the idea that I am coming up with these ideas
all on my own), proposes some alternative reasons why this might
be.[1] A much higher percentage of broken families, and a higher
percentage of AIDS (which is a behavioral disease remember, you have
to be promiscuous or drug using to get it) go a long way to explain
things, <em>if</em> you happen to believe, as I do, that the family
is the basic building block of a stable and prosperous society.</p>
