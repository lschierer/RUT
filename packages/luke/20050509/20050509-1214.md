<p>Japan, with its huge press of people, has a very high level
of complaints from women about the liberties some men have taken
in the train cars.[1] Predictably, some men are complaining,
but I really do not see another viable solution, given the press.
They <em>could</em> institute lower maximum occupancies, but they
would have a very hard time enforcing them, it would basically
require someone standing at each door letting people in and out
slowly enough that they could be counted.  In other words, it would
slow down service incredibly, raise prices (wages cost), and lower
the total capacity.  So as I was saying, I really do not see a way
around this.  Of course, this totally flies in the face of men and
women being identical. <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font></p>
