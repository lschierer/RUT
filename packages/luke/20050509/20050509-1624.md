<p>Thomas Sowell reminds us that much of what is called "black"
culture today originates and was common to the worst of southern
society in general,[1] the "white trash," the "Georgia Crackers,"
and so on.  Which correlates nicely to the fact that this "culture"
does not transcend continents all that well, and certainly does not
apply all that much to most of the immigrants.  But liberals are
about emotion, not logic.</p>
