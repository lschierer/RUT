Johannesburg, South Africa has its first confirmed snowfall in more than 25 years[^sa1].  While the city normally gets cold, with an average minimum of 4.7 degrees Celsius in June, this is the first snow they have had since 1981.   The capital, Pretoria, had its first snow since 1968, an even longer period.

Meanwhile, Australian citrus farmers are worried that their fruit might have suffered frost damage after experiencing their coldest June day *ever.*[^aufrost1]  These data points fit well with earlier news stories that it is getting colder in the Antarctic.[^anarctic1]
