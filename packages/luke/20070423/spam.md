In the last week or so, the level of spam reaching my inbox in the form of comments and trackbacks in need of moderation has grown from nearly none to many a day.  I suspect this has to do with having one category of posts syndicated at [planet.pidgin.im][].  As a result, I have installed two plugins that claim to help identify and prevent spam from reaching my notice without intruding on the submission of legitimate users, one for comments studying the tactics of common spam bots, and the other for trackbacks, requiring that a trackback be referring to a page that actually links to me.  I hope this takes care of the issue, and that I need not resort to more invasive measures.
