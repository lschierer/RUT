<p>I read today an article talking about the New Madrid fault.<a href="http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050622_new_madrid.html">[1]</a> Apparently they now think that there will almost certainly (seventy percent chance) be a significant earthquake there in the next fifty years or so.  The interesting thing here is that while they insist that plate tectonics is behind it, <em>there is only one plate on both sides of that fault</em>.  What other plate is the rubbing, sliding, snagging, whatever going on against?  How does plate tectonics explain a <em>mid plate</em> fault line?</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/050622_new_madrid.html </font>
