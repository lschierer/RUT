The thermostat for this office is downstairs.  It is set to 65.  I want to talk to Eric before I raise it much more, I do not want to be needlessly expensive.  But I am really tempted to raise it, not because I am particularly cold at 65, but because it is only 60 up here right now.   How is that possible?
