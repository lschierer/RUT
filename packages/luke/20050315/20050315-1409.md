<p> "<a href="http://www.world-science.net/othernews/050310_suntubefrm.htm">Sunlight
in a tube</a>" reports on the sort of environmentalism that we
can and should all support.  Replacing some of our florescent
lighting with transported sunlight would I think be beneficial
to more than just our pocket books.  While it will, doubtlessly,
be expensive to install such systems for the near future, over
time the cost should pay itself off in decreased electrical usage.
Additionally, everyone (except those who are allergic to sunlight
I suppose (yes, such people do exist)) must prefer natural light
to the horrid florescent lighting.  Many people even prefer the
"warmer" lighting from incandescent bulbs over florescent, even
though florescent provide brighter light longer and cheaper than the
incandescent bulbs do.  How much better to have real sunlight.</p>
