<p> I was reading <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet
debian</a> today, and noticed <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/~decklin/blog/tech/atmos">this</a>.
Someone built a clock that uses a variety of energy sources to wind
itself mechanically, with no user input beyond the initial push to
get it started after leveling it.  Ederlyn would probably find this
cool, and would most likely have a far better understanding of the
physics than the poster does.</p>
