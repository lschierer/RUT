1. Jesus is the center of what it means to be Christian, a fact that is
   demonstrated by His prominence in the Apostles' Creed (63% is about Jesus).
1. Jesus is God.  No true Christian doubts this, no non-Christian believes it.
   This is why we all ourselves "Christian" as opposed to simply "theists."
1. The incarnation is truly "the most surprising, unforeseeable, unimaginable
   thing that ever happened."
   a. This is *not* a reasonable story, people truly new to the idea have always
      been shocked at the audacity of claiming that a man is God. 
   a. God truly did *die* at the moment of the crucifixion. 
1. Jesus is both fully human and fully God. 
   a. The Church firmly rejects the idea that he is part God and part man.
   a. The Church firmly rejects the idea that he is not really God.
   a. The Church firmly rejects the idea that God only pretended or appeared to
      be man.
   a. Each of the above errors has been tried by one group of people or another
      at some point in history and *firmly rejected as wrong.*
1. Jesus is both the Son of God and yet God is still *one God.*  This is part of
   what it means for God to be a Trinity.
1. The Jews were expecting the Messiah to free them from Roman rule and
   establish the kingdom of David here on Earth, in fulfillment of the Old
   Testament Covenant.  
   a. In class we discussed how this was an unrealistic expectation because this
      covenant was broken not by God, but *by the actions of the Jews.* More,
      that this covenant was broken not just once, but almost continually over
      the course of the Old Testament.
   a. We further discussed the difference in scope between the Old and New
      Testaments.  The Old Testament covers centuries.  The New Testament
      records a 60 to 90 year period of time (depending on precisely when the
      book of Revelation was written).  This difference in scope leads to a
      difference in tone between the two sections of the Bible.
1. Jesus became man for a number of reasons.
   a. in order to save us.  Only the infinite pain of God experiencing death
      could pay for the infinite pain our sin causes God.
   a. so that we could know God's love.  Experiencing God in this personal way
      through His Church and more through His sacraments, and again through the
      example He gave us in His incarnation tells us more of the nature of God
      and His love for us than we could ever otherwise know.
   a. to give us an example of holiness.  Jesus was truly man.  As a human, he
      gives a model of how to be a holy person.
   a. to adopt us.  God was not content to leave us in our fallen state.
      Through grace we become adopted.  We were created at the bottom of the
      spiritual hierarchy.  We, through grace, are elevated. 
1. Jesus became man at a particular time for a reason. 
   The book talks fairly briefly about this.  This section actually formed the
   bulk of our discussion in class, as it is actually very important to
   understand if you are also to understand that God did not abandon us to evil
   for centuries.
1. The Grace of Baptism is required to get into Heaven, but for those who
   *through no fault of their own* do not receive that grace in this life, we
   cannot limit God.  He *may*, at His discretion, have provided other ways for
   them to have received this grace.  
1. We know this happened at least once - in the Apostles' creed we state that
   Jesus descended into hell.  Why? To provide the grace of baptism to those who
   died before His crucifixion (such as Saint Joseph). 
   a. We discussed the use of language in the Bible to denote different
      segments of hell, and how that mirrors the temporary state of purgatory
      that currently exists but will be unnecessary after the Last Judgment.
   a. We discussed that we cannot know what happens to those who do not receive
      baptism now, but that we are guessing, and in many cases hoping. 
1. The second coming.
   a. Not a lot is known for sure.
   a. We will have bodies.
   a. There will be a new earth for those bodies to be on.
   a. this new earth is necessary because the last judgment is "at the end of
      time."
   a. The last judgment is there so that we can all know, definitively, that
      God is in fact Just, and that people have truly gotten what they deserve,
      both good and bad. 
   a. No one in heaven will stop being in heaven.
   a. No one in hell will stop being in hell.
