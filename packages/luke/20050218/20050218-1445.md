Michelle Malkin is correct, "<a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3046178">Texan
arrested; said he was after bin Laden bounty</a>" is simply downright
weird.  If the guy is telling the truth, what in the world was he
thinking?  And what's up with the FBI simply assuming he is lying?
If he's serious, he isn't unreasonably equipped, though he sands
no chance at success for all that.  If he is lying, then you
<em>really</em> want to ask what in the world was he thinking?
Did he really think they would buy that excuse?  Either way here
we have lots of issues.
