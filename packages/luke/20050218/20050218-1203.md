Quite a bit happening in the news today.  A quick run down, I may
come back to some of this in more depth later.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1489955,00.html">New
proof that man has caused global warming</a>" apparently only human
caused global warming fits the data according to the models they
looked at.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050214/full/050214-17.html">Gene
map opens up uncharted territory</a>" talks about using the
genome to target certain diseases.  This is so close to being
able to target your biological weapons at certain populations
that the scientist even realized it and tried to say they
weren't looking at race.  Oh and what's up with all the pink here?
"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4275695.stm">DNA
map to help target new drugs</a>" has more on this.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.catholicherald.com/articles/05articles/separation.htm">The
Wall of Separation Between Church and State</a>" fascinating
article on why the "Separation of Church and State" is a myth
that should be overturned.  Also, interestingly, it isn't even
all that old an interpretation.  Only 60 years or so.  Sounds like
its about the same time as the right to privacy mess started to be
... um, my word choice here was about to be a little <em>too</em>
coincidental.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1151/2-18-2005/20050218024503_20.html">Bush
to Sign Bill Curbing Lawsuits</a>" affects class action law
suits.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/a/w/1153/2-18-2005/20050218050016_38.html">Senate
OKs Ban on Genetic Discrimination</a>" sounds all Gatica
like.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/features/1120/2-18-2005/20050218051502_60.html">Landlord
Tosses Tear Gas Grenade in House</a>" is weird.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-17-2005/20050217074505_26.html">Judge
Upholds Ban on Polygamous Marriage</a>" about which I can only say
"Thank goodness there is still some sanity."<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://www.livescience.com/technology/050217_robot_walking.html">New
Robots Walk Like Humans</a>" Title says it all.<br  /><br  />
