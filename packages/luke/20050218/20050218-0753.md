So, according to "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4274129.stm">Oldest
fossil 'rabbit' unearthed</a>," finding a fossil rabbit
<strong><em>20 million years earlier</em></strong> than any
previous rabbit "adds weight to the idea that rabbit-like creatures
first evolved no earlier than 65 million years ago."  I find
this fascinating.  If that confirms the theory, what would manage
to call the theory into question (without actually constituting
a contradiction of the theory)?  Would anything?  This is a
<strong>prime</strong> example of why I do not like evolution.
If something doesn't happen, that proves it wasn't designed.
If something does, it proves it did evolve.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;This
sounds so incredibly scientific to you as well I am sure.
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
