We are taking things way too far in "<a href="http://mhking.mu.nu/archives/067455.php">Eating bananas is
racist? How stupid can you get?</a>." I'm linking to this rather
than to the google archive because this is likely to be up longer,
and having read the google archive of the story, I can say it reports
accurately, though I would not have given the mayor <em>quite</em>
as hard a rap as this author does.  What does it say about us when
simply eating a banana is to make a racist statement, one that a
mayor would apologize for?
