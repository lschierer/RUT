There is so much going on in "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-15-2005/20050215001504_17.html">Appeals
Court Hears Chinese Custody Case</a>" that I don't know what to make
of it.  So many levels.  There is no way to know what went on when
"The Bakers took Anna Mae into their home as a favor to the Hes who
were out of work in a foreign country and facing large legal and
medical bills."  Did they think it was a sort of unofficial adoption?
Was it presented that way?  Or was it known to be temporary, and they
were wrong to raise her as adopted?  What about the child?  Who does
she consider "Mom" and "Dad?"  That is, I think, unquestionably
who she should stay with, regardless of the rights or wrongs of how
that came to be.  And the immigration issues involved, what a mess.
The Elian Gonzalez I think they were wrong to take him and send him
back to his father, but even that, it is so hard to be sure... The
only thing I know is that there is so much suffering when families
get broken up.  Such an incredible tragedy.
