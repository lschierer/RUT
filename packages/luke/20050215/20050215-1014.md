Michelle Malkin's "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001520.htm">How
Effective Are Flu Shots?</a>" links to "<a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/165/3/265">Impact
of Influenza Vaccination on Seasonal Mortality in the US
Elderly Population</a>" from the Archives of Internal Medicine.
She also links to a Los Angeles Times story, but I did not feel
like registering there to read it.  The upshot of all these is
more confirmation of my overall impression that flu shots aren't
worth much.<br  /><br  />

<strong><big>UPDATED: 20040215-1335</big></strong><br  />
