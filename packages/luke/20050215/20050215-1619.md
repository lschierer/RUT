Once again, two small steps forward on the moral front.  "<a href="http://www.ycvf.org/oremus/email/index36.html">OPERATION
OUTCRY: SILENT NO MORE PRAISE REPORT & CALL FOR MORE PRAYER
TO REVERSE ROE V. WADE</a>" has an interesting tidbit in it.
Did you know that Roe and Doe (of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton)
both would like to see their own decisions overturned?  Quite a
remarkable conversion.<br  /><br  />

In related news, though not a step forward, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GuestColumns/May20050214.shtml">Embryonic
stem cell research as an obsession</a>" highlights the obsession
with embryonic stem cell research, why it is unneeded, how it is,
or at least seems to be, politically motivated, and how it is
detracting from more promising and less objectionable research.
