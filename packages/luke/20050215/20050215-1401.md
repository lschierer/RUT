Ederlyn's del.icio.us listing pointed me at an amusing story
of science's early, more innocent, more honest, days: "<a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoaxmuseums.html">Museums of
Hoaxes</a>."  Of particular interest is the ability of these men to
conduct scientific inquiry that forms the foundation of much we know
today while still preserving their ability to wonder at the marvels
in creation.  As written here, many of these are pantheistic, but
you can easily see God having the same sort of fun, our sense of
humor comes from somewhere after all.
