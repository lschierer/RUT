The First Amendment does not apply to contempt of
court.  This common sense decision is documented in "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4268129.stm">CIA leak
reporters 'must testify'</a>" and is a decision that many will find
an offensive abridgment of said amendment.  Still, I tend to agree
with this decision (hence calling it common sense ;-), it seems to
me that their ability to print whatever is not being restricted, only
their ability to *withhold* information.  And withholding information
seems to be covered only under self incrimination and unreasonable
search, not under freedom of the press.  As testifying would free
them from guilt, it isn't self incrimination, and it seems that
unreasonable search isn't being argued.  So testify they must.  :-)
