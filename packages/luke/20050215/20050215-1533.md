The <a href="http://gaim.sf.net">gaim</a> <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">Off-the-Record</a>
plugin managed to attract <a href="http://news.com.com/">news.com's</a> notice.  See "<a href="http://news.com.com/Making+your+IM+secure--and+deniable/2100-7355_3-5576246.html">Making
your IM secure--and deniable</a>."  This is very cool because
security is one of the least understood concepts even in the
subset of computer users who somewhat understand their computers.
People fail to grasp that there is no guarantee that the screen
name you are talking to has not been hijacked by an attack on the
account's password or on the network itself; having a fairly common
news source talking about it cannot hurt.
