"<a href="http://www.freedomalliance.org/view_article.php?a_id=512">UN
Peacekeepers: Protectors or Predators?</a>" talks about the sexual
abuse committed at the hands of UN "Peacekeepers."  Nor is this
the first, in the book I am currently reading, <em>George Pell
Defender of the Faith Down Under</em>, I learned that the UN forces
did similar things in Asia, Cambodia I believe, though I could
be mistaken.<br  /><br  />

Sends Senate 20 Judicial Nominees</a>" has some info on George
Bush's recent court appointments.  Looks like the democrats still
want to stall these out.<br  /><br  />

Mayor Blacklists Those Who Sued City</a>" shows an interesting
approach: not doing business with companies that sue the government.
I wonder how that will hold up.
