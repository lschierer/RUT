<p>There was nothing really note worthy in the news today.  Well,
Apple is going to Intel chips from PPC ones, which I think is an
incredibly stupid move, but I did not and do not really feel like
writing much on that.  And Debian finally got sarge out the door,
but I have known about that coming 2 weeks now or so.  So I really
did not have anything to write about today.</p>

<p>This weekend was incredibly busy.  Nicholas graduated from PVI
Sunday, and so we had lots (for us, though not as a percentage of
the possible family) of family and friends around us all weekend.
We had lots of fun, or at least I did.</p>

<p>Friday morning I woke up to the realization that after the last
update Thursday, I was not just unable to start stuff in X in that
X session, but at all.  This was incredibly unacceptable.  I toyed
with trying to downgrade enough to get it to work, spending more time
than I should have on it, but gave up, realizing it was beyond me.
So I started a re-install back from Ubuntu, and then upgrading it to
Debian again, except using the non-gcc4 amd64 repository.  Gcc4 being
the start of the troubles on my previous install.  This is the second
time I have used debian's, dpkg --get-selections and --set-selections
to preserve the information on what packages are installed across
an install.  I am <em>very</em> pleased.  By Saturday evening, yes,
with the help of my dsl connection, but with very little interaction
on my part, I am back up and running.</p>
