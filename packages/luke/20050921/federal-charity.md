<p>Mr. Walter Williams succinctly outlines the concept that the federal government has no business engaging in charity and relief efforts.<sup><a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20050921.shtml">[1]</a></sup> Quoting Presidents Cleveland, Madison, and Jefferson, he demonstrates that this idea starts with the founding fathers, including the man (Madison) who largely authored the Constitution, and continued for some time in the minds of their predecessors.  This is a fact that is largely forgotten and lost today.  Particularly noteworthy is a quotation of President Cleveland that he provides:</p>  <blockquote>The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.<sup><a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20050921.shtml">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>  <p>We can clearly, perhaps more clearly than ever since it was stated, see the truth of this in the wake of Katrina.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Mr. Walter Williams.
