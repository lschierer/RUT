<p>Better than any of my words on the topic are those of Professor Robert Laughlin, professor of physics at Stanford University, and sharer in a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>  <blockquote>A key symptom of ideological thinking is the explanation that has no implications and cannot be tested. I call such logical dead ends antitheories because they have exactly the opposite effect of real theories: They stop thinking rather than stimulate it. Evolution by natural selection, for instance, which Charles Darwin originally conceived as a great theory, has lately come to function more as an antitheory, called upon to cover up embarrassing experimental shortcomings and legitimize findings that are at best questionable and at worst not even wrong.<a href="http://www.ncregister.com/current/0814lead2.htm">[1]</a></blockquote>  <font size="-2"> [1] Laughlin, Robert.  quoted in "God and Matter: The Evolution of the Evolution Debate" by Mr. Benjamin Wiker writing for the National Catholic Register 2005-08-14. http://www.ncregister.com/current/0814lead2.htm </font>
