<p>The NYTimes is all excited about the findings of a group of
Swedish researchers.  In a number of different sections of of the
times, based on my RSS feeds, they posted an article in which
homosexual men responded to a pair of chemicals thought to be
pheromones the way normal women do, not the way normal men do.[1]
The researchers claim that the data on homosexual women is "too
complicated" to publish, which leads me to question this study, how
and why could it possibly be "too complicated?"  Further, they admit
that they cannot, from this study, tell the difference between cause
and effect.  Which means that they do not know if homosexuality
is causing the changed reaction, or if the changed reaction is
causing homosexuality.  Either way, this does not detract from the
idea that homosexuality is, at root, a disease, it just means that
it may be a physical disease and not just a mental one.</p>
