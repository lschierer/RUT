<p> Yesterday I neglected to mention <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050427/ap_en_mo/bush_sanitizing_hollywood_2">this
story</a>.  It appears the Federal government decided to grant us
*some* ability to filter unnecessary and inappropriate material
out of DVDs we buy.  But only at run time with a device, not by
editing the DVD itself, or by paying someone to edit it for us.</p>
