Mr. Chuck Colson is aware of some of the research behind something
I have been saying for some time: homosexuality is a disease.[^20050616-3]
In the face of John Hopkins University's decision to offer sex
change operations in the 1970s, Mr. Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist,
attempted to redeem his profession by questioning the wisdom of
this operation.  He found that the operation, while not regretted,
did nothing to help with the varied mental problems that led to the
request.  He concluded "that Hopkins was fundamentally cooperating
with a mental illness."[^20050616-4] He also studied the cases of baby boys
who had been made to appear physically as girls when born with
"ambiguous genitals."[^20050616-5] Such children did <em>not</em> grow up
as happy well adjusted girls, but "endured 'prolonged distress
and misery.'  When they discovered their true genetic heritage,
most of them began to live as males."[^20050616-6]

This does not directly counter the beetle research I posted about
a while back, but it does demonstrate that there <em>are</em>
fundamental differences between boys and girls, and that
homosexuality can, in at least some cases, be cured.
