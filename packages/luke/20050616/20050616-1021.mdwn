<p>USA Today has a story about a Virginia family that needs
prayers.[1] The Torres family is faced with incredible suffering,
as Mrs. Susan Torres is brain dead, kept alive by a respirator,
while her body fights cancer and other illnesses so that her unborn
baby has a chance at life.  If they can reach mid-July without the
cancer reaching her uterus, the baby will have reached 25 weeks,
and will have a chance of life if delivered then.  If they can reach
30 weeks, the risks of brain, vision, and developmental damage will
be significantly less.  Pray for Mr. Jason Torres, her husband,
and their 2 year old son Peter, and for the unborn baby.</p>
