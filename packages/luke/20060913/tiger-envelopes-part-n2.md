I get an advanced copy of Tiger Envelopes 0.7.6, but it does absolutely nothing to solve my problem.  However, I do not mean this as a true criticism of the TigerPrivacy people.  It is, in a way, a sort of back-handed complement:  their turn-around time is quite simply amazing.   And to be fully honest, I think they did solve part of the problem.  Looking at the logs they asked me to gather for them when I reported that 0.7.6 did not help, I think that they did solve the ssl certs error.  It is not uncommon, in my experience, to have one bug hide or obscure the existence of another.  I believe that this may be what has happened here.  That's why I reported the failure of 0.7.6, and why I offered to provide logs of the failure (once they told me which of the zillion log files that Tiger Envelopes creates that they wanted).
