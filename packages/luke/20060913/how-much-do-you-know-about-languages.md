I would expect Damian792 to 1)do very well on this test 2)find fault with its mistakes (I am assuming there are some).  

My score on The World Languages Test:

**************************************

    Language Savvy
    (You scored  a 210 out of 400 on language knowledge.)

"Congratulations! You know your stuff! You've scored higher than most people would and you probably have taken a linguistics or cultural science class to boot. Most likely you are bilingual or even multilingual. You are also probably fascinated by languages and want to learn more of them in the future. When you travel to a foreign country, you make a point to learn some of the language instead of imposing your own. It's people like you who help promote the exchange of languages worldwide. Keep it up!"

**************************************

Take it!
