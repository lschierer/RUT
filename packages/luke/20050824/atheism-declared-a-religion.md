<p>While some are apparently upset with a recent decision that declares atheism to be a religion,<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=4697">[1]</a> I am pleased.  Where atheism firmly established as a philosophical basis legally no different from theism, then the court-enforced secularism, which amounts to court-enforced atheism, would fall apart.  You clearly cannot bar God from the public sphere if doing so amounts to an establishment (traditionally defined OR popularly defined) of atheism as a state religion.</p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Catholic News Agency.
