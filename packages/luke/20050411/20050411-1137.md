<p> "Sub vocalizing" is a common idea in science fiction,
saying words inaudible.  Some authors go so far as to say without
visible, or nearly without visible movement.  This is significant
in light of the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7247">fact that it is apparently
possible</a>.  As this is the result of military research, I
would tend to assume that this means there are now smaller and
better versions available to the military than are discussed in
the article.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, I see <a href="http://www.aip.org/pnu/2005/726.html">mention</a> of a
"bio-transistor" that could be used for a brain-machine interface.
Cyborgs just get closer and closer it seems.  I am still not sure
what I make of this trend.</p>
