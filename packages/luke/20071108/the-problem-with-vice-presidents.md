Is that they effectively have no power.  That is why even if former governor Mike Huckabee is chosen as the vice-presidential candidate for one of the pro-death candidates, which the Associated Press thinks likely,[^200711081] the quandary I expressed yesterday[^200711082]  will remain in full force.   I doubt picking Mr. Huckabee as his vice president will represent a true and substantial shift away from the pro-death, anti-family stance that Giliani represents, nor that Mitt Romney is *really* pro-life.
