We finally have a server to host the project!!  Donated and hosted by dvlabs.com, this is a huge step forward for us as a project.  I am slowly configuring it, getting apache2, subversion, planet, mysql, and such up and running.  It is a slow process, but fortunately we are not pressed for time yet.
