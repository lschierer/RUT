More accurately, polygyny is already there, the question is whether or not it will become officially legal.[^200708301]  I am disgusted almost beyond words.  The one comment worthy aspect of the article is the trenchant observation that freedom of religion would have to give way if this were a question of homosexual rights or marriage, but is held up as absolute when it comes to polygynous marriage.   It is almost beyond belief.  How can a people that celebrates the value of women allow this&#x203d;
