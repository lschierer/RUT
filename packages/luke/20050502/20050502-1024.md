<p> "<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7681252/">Scientists
create animals that are part-human</a>" is a sort of crossover
science/pro-life article.  Transplants from animals have saved lives,
no question about it.  But something disturbs me in the thought of
using animals to grow actual human organs.  I do not know, where
does the line lay?  Where does this cross the bounds of moral means?
These are questions that the scientists will never adequately ask,
and our government cannot be trusted to answer.  We must think
about this.  I thank God once again for giving us a scholar Pope
to lead us through these times.</p>
