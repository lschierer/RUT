<p> Kansas <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-29-2005/555f0019b6068ea9.html">just
barely fails</a> to override a veto on a bill to require abortion
clinics get an annual license.  Apparently its too much to ask that
they be (relatively) clean and safe (for the mother, its a given
that the child will be killed).</p>

<p>Thursday on my interminable drive home, Sean Hannity
said that he thinks that the mental inhibition against
harming a child, once crossed, is something that dehumanizes
the person.  I cannot help but think of that as I see <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/04-29-2005/221b000dd5e4ea54.html">a
mother charged with killing her children</a>.  What is wrong with
our society that this is not even the first time this sort of charge
has been made in recent memory?</p>
