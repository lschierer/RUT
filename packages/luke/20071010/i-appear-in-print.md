A few days ago several of us (Pidgin developers) were approached by Ms. Dahna McConnachie asking for an interview for the Australian version of PC World.  Apparently I was one of the only developers to respond to her request, and as a result, I have now appeared in print.[^200710101]  I only spent an hour or so answering her questions, and I did not take the time to read it over as I should have.  On the other hand, it appears she did not spend much if any time editing it either.  For example, she clearly googled to see what "oscar" is, but came up with a totally wrong acronym.  Still, I think it is cool in a way to be interviewed. 

(The expansion of "oscar" was removed about 14:43 EDT)
