<p> The next step is Justice Anthony Kennedy.  <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050323/D890NGL80.html">From</a>
the AP News:</p>

<blockquote><p>An emergency filing to the high court would go first
to Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Reagan appointee who has staked a
moderate position on social issues.</p>

<p>Kennedy would have the option to act on the petition alone,
although on previous emergency requests involving Schiavo he has
referred the matter to the full nine-member court.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jenn explains: "there are certain justices assigned to a district.
they can order stays on their own if the petition comes from their
own districts."</p>

someone the doctors looking at Mrs. Schiavo would have concluded
was vegetative.</p>
