<p> David Limbaugh wrote a (for him, and, I suppose, for me
also) long post on the Schiavo that has been so much in the
news of late, and so much of the focus of my own writing.
He expressed some of the concerns that I have felt,
but, perhaps, not adequately expressed.  Many things that
resonate strongly with me.  I highly suggest you read it at "<a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/03/schiavo_writ_la.html">Schiavo
Writ Large</a>."  I really can't express things better than he has.
He hits the nail on the head with the disquieting way that evidence
in favor of her recover-ability, of her consciousness, is being
ignored.  He hits the nail on the head at the way that the abortion
movement is pro-death, not pro-choice.  He hits the nail on the
head that saving the life of this woman is more important to many of
us who pray for her than the possible damage to our governance the
efforts to save her may cause.  We the living can take care of any
damage done later.  We can worry about it after we ensure that we
will be alive to do it, that our children will be alive to do it.
That the next generation will not be aborted, that we will not be
killed by a government or "health care" industry that no longer
values life.</p>
