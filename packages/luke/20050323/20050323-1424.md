<p> Two bits of science news today.  "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7180">Classic
maths puzzle cracked at last</a>" talks about patterns in numbers.
Mathematicians were apparently surprised as they discovered how
prevalent these are, but I am not.  It is the same sort of argument
that is being made when you look at the finite ranges in which life
as we know it could exist.</p>

<p>The other is "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/23/science/23gene.html?ei=<?php echo htmlentities("5088&en=00306bf37c75a71b&ex=1269234000&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=");?>">Startling
Scientists, Plant Fixes Its Flawed Gene</a>," which suggests there
may be more to heredity than Mendel's laws and DNA.  If so, this
would raise the explanatory bar for evolution <em>significantly</em>
higher, as a mutation must get past this extra set of non-DNA
based accuracy checks.  Why have we not noticed this before?
Perhaps because it was not looked for?</p>
