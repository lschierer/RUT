"The greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?" &mdash;Mother Teresa (Speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, February 3, 1994)
