I went to bed last night willing, reluctantly, to conceed that the results for the various amendments across the country might not be in the news.  I probably should have looked harder.  This morning I accepted no such conclusion and found them on CNN.<sup>[\[1\]][ref1]</sup>  Scanning the list:

* They are not yet calling it, but it looks like the Same-Sex "Marriage" ban will fail in Arizona by about thirty thousand votes.
* Colorado voted against domestic partnerships, 53% to 47%.
* They also voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 56% to 44%.
* Idaho voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 63% to 37%.
* Missouri voted to allow embryonic stem cell research, 51% to 49%, a forty-five thousand vote difference.
* Parental Notification failed in Oregon, 54% to 46%.
* South Carolina voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 78% to 22%.
* South Dakota failed to ban abortion, 44% to 56%.
* News from South Dakota is not all bad, they voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 52% to 48%.
* Tennessee voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 80% to 20%.
* <strong><big>Virginia voted to ban Same-Sex "Marriages," 57% to 43%.</big></strong>
