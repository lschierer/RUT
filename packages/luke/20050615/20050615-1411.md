<p>Ms. Phyllis Schlafly has some interesting facts on the way the
courts have furthered the destruction of the concept of fatherhood
in our society.[1] You see a similar dynamic in the areas of
sexual assault and domestic violence: you are considered guilty
from the moment the charge comes out.  You are considered guilty
even if found innocent.  Your attempts to defend yourself will
just earn you greater enmity from society, from your persecutors,
and from the legal system.  Both crimes are real.  Both deserve
<em>severe</em> punishment.  But we have forgotten that not all
men accused are guilty.  We have even forgotten that not all men
are even accused of them.</p>
