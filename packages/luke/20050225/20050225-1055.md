You can sense how much some of the Church's hierarchy are hoping
for a different pope in some of the anonymous comments in "<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050225/D88FHNMO0.html">Pope
Breathing on Own Again; No Infection</a>."  It is not as
overt as some articles are, thankfully, but it is still
really sad to hear about people hoping to capitalize on our
Pope's death.  The BBC has a slightly different article on this,
"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4296537.stm">Pope 'is
breathing for himself'</a>," which thinks there are "ethical problems
as to whether and to what extent his life should be preserved by
artificial means."
