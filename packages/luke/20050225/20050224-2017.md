We are releasing gaim 1.1.4 today, just a week after 1.1.3; we
found a couple crashers (one a security risk) and are now working
around a bug in glib 2.6.2 (on some platforms).  It always gives me
a thrill to release even for something like this, that I'd rather
have caught for 1.1.3.<br  /><br  />

In other news, its been snowing all day, but not really sticking to
the roads until recently, it has been too warm of late.  It made
for a slow and boring day at work, consistently wishing it would
snow enough to justify going home.  Thankfully I'd gotten in early
and skipped lunch, so I was able to leave at 4:30, I can't imagine
having stayed till 6 as I usually do.  I found out last night that
Andrius is engaged, yay! :-) I had an a fairly good talk with
Vincas at Pub Quiz (one of our teams won!), nice and geeky, on
Unicode and the text replacement plugin.  Oddly, hyphenated isn't
able to reproduce the wide character bug that has been reported,
and I am unable to find the report.  Ah-well, such is life.
