The double standards in society are absolutely amazing.
Michelle Malkin gets on the main stream media's case
for their discussion of Condoleezza Rice's attire <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001595.htm">here</a>.
David Limbaugh <a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/mt/archives/2005/02/washington_post.html">does
also</a>, but I think Malkin's post is better.
