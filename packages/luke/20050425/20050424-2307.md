<p> Wow, it looks like the Roseville Joint Union
High School District in Sacramento, California
picked on the wrong parent!!  According to <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43953">this
article</a>, a Mr. Larry Caldwell is suing the school district
for violating "his constitutional rights to free speech, equal
protection and religious freedom."  He is also seeking a retraction
from a Eugenie Scott, who has some connection to the case that
is not made clear.  This Scott person (is "Eugenie" a guy's name
or a girl's name?) apparently rather drastically misrepresented
Mr Caldwell's proposal and position.  It really is not atypical
for Darwinists to do this, to try to make you look like a rabidly
fanatical evangelical.  They do this so that anyone except another
rabidly fanatical evangelical (or someone like me who is familiar
with their tactics) will dismiss you out of hand without considering
your arguments.  They cannot win on the merits you see, because
"Intelligent Design" really is not saying anything most people would
disagree with.  It is about time someone took advantage of the fact
that they can't keep the straw-man attacks out of the debate!</p>
