<p> Michelle Malkin <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002216.htm">noted</a>
the key fact in <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/45270.htm">this NY
Post article</a>.  Had this gone the other way, would police have
hesitated even one second in classifying it as a hate crime?  I do
not think so!  So why was this not treated as one right off the bat?
Could it be that some groups are more equal than others? hhhmmm.</p>
