<p> A Science run down here.</p>

<ul> <li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/songbirds.html">Bird's
brains reveal source of songs</a>" Apparently humans have a similar
structure in the brain.  So this might shed some light on learning
to talk.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=<?php echo
htmlentities("IE320050424061423&Page=3&Title=Features+-+Health+%26+Science&Topic=166");
?> ">Scientists overcome 'fermentation barrier'</a>" talks about
a cheaper way to produce hydrogen.  Fairly cool.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/science/25brain.html?position=<?php
echo
htmlentities("&ei=5088&en=2130498ceadb4c01&ex=1272081600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&adxnnlx=1114440231-4HB3Cjc2OBt57nn/vN/BNA");
?>">Improved Scanning Technique Uses Brain as Portal to Thought</a>"
talks about some scientists figuring out what people were looking at,
without the standard eye trackers, but with some sort of MRI.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4472521.stm">Fierce
ants build 'torture rack'</a>" is not really a torture rack in any
meaningful sense of the word.  These ants just have a particularly
gruesome hunting method.</li>

<li>"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4473641.stm">
Alzheimer's gene therapy hailed</a>" rather speaks for itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, some minimal progress with the brain, none of it
any real concern that I see, a promising development in medicine,
and some interest in biology.</p>
