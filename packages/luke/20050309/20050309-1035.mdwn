<p> Lest you think otherwise, the ACLU is not
the only anti-religious organization out there.  "<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/632/03-08-2005/b753001814e05ffc.html">Court
OKs AmeriCorps, Catholic School Link</a>" reports that of all groups,
the American Jewish Congress is trying to prevent Americorps from
placing teachers in religious schools, and from partially reimbursing
religious colleges that aid in preparing the teachers.  Not at all
what I would expect to see a religious organization doing.  Anyway, I
am always somewhat suspicious of seeing federal funding used towards
religious education, I am constantly fearful that it will be used
as an opening to try to legislate what can go on in these schools.
We have seen that fear mirrored in some colleges that will not accept
federal student aid money for the same reason, at least I think we
have, I would need to look it up and verify that fact again.</p>
