<p> Geologists have decided to worry about
the odds of a "super-volcano" erupting.  "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4326987.stm">Experts
weigh super-volcano risks</a>" reports that they think these happen
in the range of once per 100,000 years.  They think that this could
devastate food production and communication, causing starvation
that would far outstrip the recent tsunami.  Oh, and it would drop
global temperatures 5 to 10 degrees Celsius, or about 9 to 18 degrees
Fahrenheit.  Could this be a cure for global warming then? ;-)</p>
