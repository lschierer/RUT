"In our culture, it's become accepted that men, by their nature, are brutes, jerks or buffoons, while women, by theirs, are loyal, smart and admirable. Men, bad. Women, good. That's the underlying worldview of the majority of the entertainment, education and even public policy (laws) that surround us."[^200709171]
