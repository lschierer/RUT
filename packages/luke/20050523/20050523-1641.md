<p>Another abortion case is going to be heard at the United States
Supreme Court.  This one is on the parental notification laws.[1]
New Hampshire "forgot" to make an exception for minor's health in
the event of a medical emergency.  Perhaps because such clauses
get abused by pro-death doctors.  Anyway, with the current Supreme
Court mix, I do not expect anything good to come of this.</p>
