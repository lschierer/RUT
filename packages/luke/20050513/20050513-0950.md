<p>Slavery is thriving even in Britain, as Police there find that
hundreds of children, mostly black children, are vanishing from
the schools each year.[1] Naturally Britain, socialist state that
it is, is looking to solutions such as attempting to register each
and every child and tracking them to try to solve the problem.
But I think and fear that it can only truly be solved by a return
of morality to the forefront of every day life.  Interestingly,
when I first read Mr. Belloc's essays, I dismissed this one as
a prediction that he had gotten wrong.  Later, I rethought it in
terms of the similarities between slavery as it was and the debt
system we have now.  Now I am seeing that this is not just a problem
in the third world, but even in a first world (declining, highly
technical population) country like Britain.  As police fail to curb
this, I wonder if we <em>will</em> see this become more socially
accepted in Europe.  If so, it is only a matter of time before it
migrates across the border to our own country, if it has not already
(Sweat shops with immigrants working in them anyone?).</p>
