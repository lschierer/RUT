<p>The USCCB has launched an initiative to try to change public
opinion, or at least Catholic opinion, on immigrants.[1] Immigrants
help our country and society in a number of ways, from doing the
hard jobs, to enriching our culture (on a superficial note, would
we have the wealth of food types without them?).  The bishops are
highlighting the problems in the immigration system, from bias
against them among us, to the difficulty getting into this country,
a difficulty that some claim causes the illegal immigration.
Additionally, the ID mess strikes immigrants particularly hard.
We use the same few IDs (birth certificate, drivers license, social
security number) for pretty much everything, and an immigrant can
have trouble getting providing these things.</p>
