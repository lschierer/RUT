I hate Windows.  I really really do.  So I am particularly displeased that I spent part of Friday installing Windows 2k, only to find out that it is too old to be able to handle my processor, and so spent part of today installing Windows XP.  All of this because 3ware is too lazy to port the program they wrote for getting the backplane lights to work correctly to either freedos or (better) linux.  UGH.  I was working with XP for all of 15 minutes (messing with drivers then running the utility) and even in that short period it managed to refresh my hatred of it.
