I am amused to find myself quoted <a href="http://www.bautforum.com/general-science/51643-large-hadron-colliders-danger-33.html#post1319625">here</a> as an example of what all creationists argue.  I would have thought that he could have found a better source.  I am not really sure what he was trying to accomplish by quoting me though.
