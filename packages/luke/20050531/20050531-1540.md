<p>Not every family is in the financial or physical situation to be
able to provide the care that an elderly relative can often come
to need.  Ideally of course, you would take care of your family
yourself, live in close proximity, or as health deteriorates,
have a parent or grandparent move in.  Still, I recognize, have
seen in my own family, that sometimes the assistance of assisted
living or a nursing facility becomes necessary.  If you are not
able to lift them for example&#x2026;.  Still, the nursing home
is in and of itself less than ideal.  Further, it is not used as a
last resort by far too big a percentage of the family.  Even worse,
many elderly people are more or less abandoned in such facilities,
visited rarely if at all, nearly forgotten except the occasional
phone call, sometimes even living far from any family.  To make
matters worse, Toyota seems to think it would be a good idea to
delegate the care of these people to a robotic staff.[1] Now they
are to be denied even the minimal comfort of contact with unknown,
harried, and busy staff.  Perhaps worse, they want to delegate
the raising of children to robots, when intuition, common sense,
instinct, <em>and</em> research all highlight the absolute critical
nature of human interaction in a child's development.  This is a
tragic development.</p>
