Michelle Malkin has a good run down of the No Child Left Behind Act
in "<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001585.htm">The
Revolt Against No Child Left Behind</a>."  This bill is being
challenged in all sorts of ways, which I think is good, as I do not
like the idea of the Federal Government meddling with our schools
and our children's education.  Local control is far better, with
local control you can occasionally get good things going, as for
instance somewhere in southern Virginia the kids are being bussed
to the local churches for religion classes during the school day.
Can you imagine a federal program doing that?  In this era of
"separation of Church and State"?
