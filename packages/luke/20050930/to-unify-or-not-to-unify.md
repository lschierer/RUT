<p>What in the world does it mean for a protestant church to be "unified" with Rome if it means no changes?  That is the question posed by the announcement that "The Anglican Church in America has decided to seek union with the Roman Catholic Church."<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5024">[1]</a></sup> but that "from a basic theological and operational standpoint, nothing will be different within the church."<sup><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5024">[2]</a></sup></p>  <font size="-2"> [1] Catholic News Agency. "Anglican group seeks reunion with Rome" 2005-09-30. http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5024 </font>
