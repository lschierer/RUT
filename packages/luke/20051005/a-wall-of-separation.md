<p>The National Catholic Register has picked up on a story that even the ARN blog has pretty much dropped.<sup><a href="http://www.ncregister.com/articulo2.php?artkod=OTA=">[1]</a></sup> The treatment of Dr. Richard Sternberg by the Smithsonian Institute is truly revealing, it more clearly shows how much the Intelligent Design debate is a conflict of philosophies rather than of science than any other recent event has done so.  It is, as the article states, particularly interesting because Dr. Sternberg's crime was not <em>believing</em> Intelligent Design, but failing to exclude it. So desperate are they to enforce their philosophy, that they will ruin anyone, even one of their own, if the wall preventing the Intelligent Design community from publishing in mainstream scientific journals is breached.</p>  <font size="-2"> <ol> <li> Mr. Benjamin Wiker.
