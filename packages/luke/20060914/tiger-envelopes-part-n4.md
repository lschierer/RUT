0.7.6-rc2 is also a no-go.  It seems to get the ssl right (at last), but fails to log me in over IMAPS.  Looking at the logs, I am unsure if it is sending luke@schierer.org or luke@@luke@schierer.org, but either way, it should be sending just luke.  At least, that is what I think is happening.  We will see what I hear next from them.
