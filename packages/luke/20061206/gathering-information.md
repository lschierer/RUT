This last week or so Lauren and I have been trying to gather information about our options for the reception.  I have been doing some of the calling because I have a real land line, while she is limited to her cell phone while in Richmond.

The caterers seem oriented towards getting you in to meet them, versus providing information over the phone.  Couple this with my ineptitude with the phone, and you can imagine the result.  I am not getting far, and we will likely not have much more information than the website provides until we go in to meet with each in turn.  &#x2639;
