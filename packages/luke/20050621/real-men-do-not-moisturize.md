<p>Mentioned again today,[1] I wonder if Andrius has seen the pamphlet "Real Men Moisturize" that I know about primarily from having read the same column by Ms. Mona Charen that today's article references.[2] Such a <em>lovely</em> image to be sending overseas.  Why was it that Hitler thought the United States would not affect the outcome of World War II (I could be referring to whoever lead Germany in World War I here, not Hitler, my grasp of history is not what it should be)?  Might it have been because he thought we were all spineless "playboys"?  Might that have been because of the State Department then just as someone reading this current pamphlet might come to a similar conclusion?  I wonder&#x2026;</p>
