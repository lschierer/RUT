<p>You just have to love Unix.  Just when I am starting to get really frustrated with the fact that the only working command line tool to post to a WordPress web log that I can find does not seem to handle line breaks acceptably, I pause and switch tracks.  Looking at the available command line tools from the coreutils package, it comes to mind that I have seen "tr" do some interesting things (when I am following the howto for burning audio cds).  Sure enough, that lets me simply delete all the end line characters out of my file, which, since I tend to type in enough HTML to cause it to display correctly, is perfectly acceptable, I only have it formatted to 70 characters per line for Aspell purposes anyway. Yay for command line tools! <font size="+2">&#x263a;</font></p>
