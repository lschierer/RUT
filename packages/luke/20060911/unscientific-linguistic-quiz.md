Even though this quiz has been deemed entirely unscientific,<sup><a href="http://damian792.livejournal.com/23649.html" title="Whatchutalkinbout Willis?">[1]</a></sup> it still managed to peg the fact that much of my family, and thus presumably my speech, comes from the north.  I am not sure where it got the 5%Upper Midwestern from.  I myself noted flaws in 3 questions, notably #10 where there was no correct answer for me, I had never heard of <em>any</em> of the three phrases.  On a side note, I was visiting an aunt of mine on the eastern shore this weekend.  She and my uncle retired there, but grew up and worked in the DC area.  Her "Warshington" is <em>much</em> more pronounced than mine is.
