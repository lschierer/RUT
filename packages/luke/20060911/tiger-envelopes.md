I see that the 0.7.5 version of Tiger Envelopes<sup><a href="http://www.tigerprivacy.com/" title="Tiger Envelopes - Stop snoops from reading your email. For free. Forever.">[1]</a></sup> now supports IMAP and IMAPS.  This is very good news.  If it works correctly, I should finally be able to get my mom up and running using it, something that one of her friends has wanted very much.

Tiger privacy is a mildly cool idea, offering secrecy but not strong authentication.  The idea parallels the name, to turn email in to a series of letters in envelopes instead of postcards.  Normally I would prefer something stronger, such as gnupg (which I do have a key for, though I do not use it much currently), but for someone such as my mom, this is preferable.  It will handle advertising its presence and setting up keys for her, which saves me the effort of trying to teach her.
