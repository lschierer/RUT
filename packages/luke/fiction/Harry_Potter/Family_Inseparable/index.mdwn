# Family Inseparable
## By Musings of Apathy[^20180701-2] and Luke Schierer

### Author's Note:
The first nine chapters of this are copied, with permission, from Musings of Apathy's work with the same name.[^20180701-3]  I have modified it some to make it very slightly less of an alternate universe (Mr. Lovegood's first name for example), and to correct a few grammer errors.  Most of the characters and world mechanics in this work come from the Harry Potter world, which is trademarked by J. K. Rowling.  I do not own them, and do not make any profit from this work.  Many thanks to both J. K. Rowling and Musings of Apathy.
