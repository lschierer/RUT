## Family Inseparable

### Chapter 6

By: Musings of Apathy  
Edited by Luke Schierer

* * *

Ginny burst into her room as soon as she could leave the table. Her
brother had seen her husband, creating a near disaster. When she saw
her husband where he usually was, on the bed under the protections of
the cloak and galaxy, she took a breath and calmed herself. She slowed
down and turned her face from Harry. She slowly walked over to the closet
and retrieved her pyjamas

"Ginny?" Harry asked, startled at her coldness. "What's going on?"

She did her best to ignore him, stripping and changing into her night
clothes.

"What's going on Ginny?" Harry asked. When she continued to ignore him,
he shucked his invisibility cloak. He had never had to worry about that
before. Ever since their marriage, she seemed to be able to know where
he was. At least, she always talked to the right spot. Now she wasn't
acknowledging that he was in the room. "Ginny, honey, what's going on?"

Ginny heard Harry sounding more and more worried, but she was mad at him
for risking their time together so he could make a floo call. And what
was he doing making a floo call while they were having breakfast? She
wasn't prepared for him to be taking risks like that. It worried her,
and that made her mad.

Harry was still feeling ignored completely by his wife. Thinking
his galaxy had malfunctioned or reset or something, he looked at it
closely. Not seeing any indication that it was doing anything, much less
doing it wrong, he removed that as well. Now he sat in only his trousers
and t-shirt, with no magical aids. "Ginny?"

Ginny tried her best to ignore her husband, but he was sounding so...and
he had taken off his protections. Was he trying to be seen?

"Ginny, dear," Harry started, using the terms that he had heard her
father use for her mum. "Is something wrong?"

Was something wrong? Ginny snapped. "Is something wrong?" she asked
hotly. "Is something wrong? I'm playing merry-hell at you right now. You
stood there in front of Percy when you knew that I wasn't ready for
you...us to be revealed. And now look at you! You've taken off all your
protections. Get your galaxy and cloak back on. Mum could come in here
any second. Bats Hollow! I wasn't going to talk to you, and look how
well that lasted!"

"He was out of it," Harry pleaded for a second before her evil eye had
him putting on his galaxy and cloak. Even after his head disappeared from
view, her eyes never left his, although they softened a bit once he was
again protected. "He didn't think I was anything real, some hallucination
of an elf or something. Called me Santa before I even took my cloak
off. I wasn't discovered, was I? Your family doesn't know, do they?"

"No," she answered. "You'd have been dragged out of this room long before
now if you had been discovered."

Suddenly they both seemed to deflate. Their argument, for what it was,
was moot. Ginny questioned him on what he was doing, and he avoided
telling her, claiming a surprise. It wasn't long before Ginny had to make
an appearance downstairs with the rest of the family, after departing so
soon after dinner. Harry might have normally been at her side, invisible,
but the scare earlier had her forbidding it. Harry didn't think that
such a bad thing.

Later that night, after Ginny had returned for bed, Harry thought to
ease the tension a bit and make them both feel better. Through the days
since their marriage, they had both been thinking about how wonderful the
ritual felt that bonded them. It seemed a good distraction for them both,
only, Harry felt shy about it and was cautious on his approach.

"Ginny," Harry said, breaking the silence. "You ... you enjoyed the
marriage ceremony ... um ritual the other day, right?"

"Hmm? Oh, yes! It was great, Harry. Why?"

"Well ... when it was done, we both said that we should do it again,
and I was wondering ... would you? Like to do it again?"

Ginny didn't have to consider it for more than a moment before answering,
"Yes, of course. You mean right now?"

"Sure," Harry said with a little more confidence.

"But it's bed time and we don't have another vine. Do you think that
one," she pointed to the still flowering vine that had been stuck in the
planter box outside her window. It seemed to be taking root and happy,
"would work again?"

"No," Harry said. "I think it's better to let it grow. It seems to like
it there. Maybe there's another ritual in that book where you found the
last one."

Harry walked over to where the book was haphazardly layed between an old
issue of Witch Weekly recycled from her mother and a vase of wilting
wild flowers that had been picked before Harry's birthday. In it they
found a couple of possibilities, however most of the others were out
of the question with Harry being still in secret. Having a minister or
someone else to the Burrow to officiate a marriage between the youngest
and a boy the family had never seen was completely out of the question.

In the end, they selected a simple idea, one that wasn't too dissimilar
to the core of modern muggle marriage ceremonies. Using the guidelines
in the book, they swore an oath to each other to support and honour the
other for the rest of their lives. Unlike in the similar muggle ceremony,
there was a flare of magic to seal the deal, adding another layer to
their marriage bond, and seeing them off to sleep with smiles on their
faces. The feeling they received in the first ritual was repeated in
the second, maybe even with a bit more to it.

* * *

The next morning was nearly a catastrophe. Harry was, as always, firmly
planted below the covers with his arms and legs intertwined with Ginny's
on the small bed. Disaster nearly struck when Arthur Weasley, Ginny's dad,
decided to be the one to wake his daughter on her eighth birthday. Even
days later, Harry would have no idea how he was not discovered. He heard,
in his half awake state, someone entering the room. Ginny was still
breathing slowly, still asleep completely. He heard Ginny's father
whispering, "Happy Birthday," while he gently shook her shoulder. In
all that, his hand was less than an inch from Harry's face, through
the blanket, and Harry could clearly hear his whispered greeting to his
daughter as she awoke, owing to the fact that his ear was not more than
a dozen inches away.

Ginny must have managed to keep him covered, but Harry could not recall
how, just that it had worked. He stayed laying in the bed still as a
stuffed dragon while Ginny got up, pausing only to put on her robe,
before following her dad to breakfast. After the door was firmly shut
Harry heaved a sigh of relief. Now he just needed to find something to
do while he waited for his wife to finish her birthday breakfast. He
hadn't even got the chance yet to wish her a happy birthday, or even a
good morning.

* * *

Ginny's birthday started out as any newly minted eight year old little
girl could want; she had all of her brothers, her mum and her dad around
the breakfast table, which was overflowing with every thing she loved
to eat. Her mum had even made eggy bread with a basket of berries,
rashers of bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs piled high, along with many
other breakfast delights. The sideboard behind the twins was piled with
presents. The array of brown paper wrapped gifts was enough to bring a
smile to her face. In a family that traditionally saved its knuts for
better uses; presents were not normally wrapped in expensive, colourful
paper. Why waste the a sickle or three for a roll of fancy paper, when
each of the children were used to plain packing paper?

Bill called out an enthusiastic, "Happy Birthday, Sprite!" which was
echoed by the rest of the family. Her mum came over from the stove
and gave her a huge hug, which was, as always, returned with just as
much enthusiasm. She had no sooner been released from her mum's grasp
then she was enveloped in Bill's birthday hug, and from there to the
next. Even Ron, the one most likely to dismiss his little sister, was
ready to issue his hug on her birthday morning.

"See, sis," Ron said, "I'm still a year older than you."

Her answering tongue was enough to earn her a serious tickle in return
from her youngest brother. She laughed as she was released and ushered
by Ron to her normal spot at the table. Expected but appreciated, her
normal chair was changed for a regal looking gilt throne. Breakfast
flowed in a happy cacophony, each and every one of the family happy on
this celebratory occasion.

It didn't take that long for Ginny to finish to her stomach's
satisfaction, at least compared to her bothers. Bill and Charlie were
having a contest, seeming to see who could have the most plates of eggy
bread, each with a pile of the red raspberries that filled the woven
basket at the centre of the table. Ginny watched with rapt attention
and laughed along with the rest of the family.

"Go ahead and have another serving of berries, Ginny," her mother said
from her side. She looked up into her mum's smiling face. "There's
plenty. Whatever doesn't get eaten will just spoil."

"Somehow, mum, I don't think that will be a problem at the rate they
are going," Ginny answered. "Besides, I don't think I could eat anything
more."

Molly smiled at her daughter, "That's alright dear. Save some room for
lunch with your grandmum. She'll be by to pick you up at twelve. She's
taking you out to lunch, so dress in your best."

Ginny allowed an excited smile to grace her face as she agreed. Quickly
after that, breakfast ended and Bill was levitating presents to the
cleared table. The brown wrapped packages, floated over single file,
covered a good portion of the table.

"Okay, Ginny," her father said. "You know the drill. Open presents this
morning and eat cake tonight."

"Come on, lets see what you got."

However, before she could tear into any of the packages before her,
an average size owl alighted into the kitchen and landed between her
and her presents. Clutched in the brown owl's talons was another brown
package, tied in string. Blinking, Ginny relieved it of its burden. The
owl nodded its head slightly before leaping in the air and leaving
through the kitchen window, just as it had arrived.

"Go ahead, Ginny, open it."

"What is it?"

"Okay," she agreed.

She pulled at the loose end of the bow, unravelling the tie and causing
the paper to fall away, revealing brightly coloured paper, wrapped around
a small rectangular object. The paper showed a meadow scene with different
size books flapping their covers, flying from tree to tree and bush to
bush. Other books masquerading as animals scurried and strolled across
the scene, making an unusual package indeed.

"Wow," she exclaimed. "I think it's from the book store."

This was echoed by most of her brothers as she held the wrapped book up
for the others to see.

"Flourish and Blotts?" Percy clarified. "Must be. Nice wrapping anyway."

"Who is it from, dear?" her mum asked.

"I don't know. There's no card," she answered before turning it over and
slitting her finger in the paper folds to loosen the sticking charm the
wrapping was folded with. Inside she found just the kind of book she
had mentioned to the twins. The cover was embossed with Sir Gwondol's
Quest at the top and John Isaic Pennyworth at the bottom with a windowed
scene of a knight on a white stallion in front of a majestic castle. She
opened the cover to find no note or inscription to identify the giver,
and at the start of the first chapter there was naught but the greeting;
Hello. Welcome to a tale of a brave knight and a beautiful princess. What
is your name?

Ginny giggled and closed the book. She smiled greatly. "Fred, George,
did you get this for me? It's the one I asked you for."

"No," they denied. "Ours is the long one on top of the stack."

Ginny thought for a moment before realization struck. "Oh! I know who
sent it!" she blurted out. Luckily not mentioning exactly who it was.

"Who, Gin?" her father asked.

"Hmm," she stalled. After a bit of thought she answered, "a friend of
Luna's. They must have found out when my birthday was and had it sent."

"That was nice of them," Molly smiled. "Be sure you send a thank you
note. Errol will be available for a delivery tonight."

A good portion of the morning was taken up with the family watching
Ginny unwrap and appreciate the gifts they, and family further afield,
had gotten her. In the stack were several from long time friends of
Arthur's from the Ministry that had known her from birth. She made sure
to thank each of her brothers and her parents when she unwrapped a gift
from each of them with a sincere hug and a kiss on the cheek, much to
Ron's embarrassment. With the gift portion of her birthday morning taken
care of, she enlisted help to take her newly gained clothes and sweets
to her room. She now had enough fudges, cakes and pasties to enjoy for
weeks, even with her hidden husband helping her enjoy them all. Entering
her room, all evidence of Harry's existence was well hidden, just as
she knew it would be. She quickly ushered her brothers out of the room,
claiming the need to bathe and change for lunch with Grandmum, getting
them all out of the way and the door firmly closed.

That taken care of, she turned around for her first ever Happy Birthday
wish from her husband.

* * *

With Grandmum Prewett due at noon, before preparing lunch for her boys,
Molly Weasley made sure to venture up the stairs to remind her daughter
to ready herself with a fresh bath and nice clothes. She found her
daughter well into a long bath, covered in her foamy bubble bath and
laughing uproariously. Molly simply reminded her that she had just an
hour before her grandmum would show.

By the time Ginny and Harry exited the bath, they had started to wrinkle
and prune from the long sit in the water. They dried and robed, saving
dressing for their room. Their teeth brushed and ears cleaned, inside
and out, they exited the bathroom and made their way to their bedroom.

As they passed Percy and Bill's room, they saw the two of them
sitting on one of the two beds with a chess set between the two in
concentration. Bill looked up and smiled. What he saw was his little
sister, nothing giving away that there was another with her.

"How you doin', Moppet?" Bill asked. "Having a good birthday?"

Ginny smiled brightly and skipped into the room, latching onto her
eldest brother to give him a neck crushing hug. "Yes, I'm having the
best time in the world!" She let Bill go and surprised her middle brother
with an identical hug for him, which elicited a smile and a return hug,
despite Percy's taciturn nature. She exited the room as she had entered;
with a happy skip to her step.

* * *

At noon Ginny and Harry were ready and waiting in the kitchen watching
Molly finish fixing lunch for the boys. Harry, fascinated with the
family clock once again, nudged his wife when the "Grandmum Prewett"
hand moved from home to travelling to visiting, accompanied with a light
popping noise outside the back door, in the garden. Almost before the
pop had ended, Ginny was on her feet and opening the door to greet her
Grandmum. To not give himself away, Harry stood at the same time as his
wife, but merely placed himself out of the way in the unused corner of
the room.

Outside the door, Ginny flew into the arms of an older woman. She was
rubenesque with plump, rosy cheeks and an obviously happy demeanour She
hugged the petite girl, enfolding her with her short arms and carrying
Ginny into the air with a laughed greeting. Harry had to smile from
under his cloak at seeing his wife happy.

"Molly, dear," the woman greeted as she entered with her arm over Ginny's
shoulder as the child hugged her grandmum's waist. "How are you and your
lovely family?"

"I'm well," she answered with a smile. "As are the boys and Arthur. Bill
has been enjoying his time working at the bank and the twins are eagerly
waiting for their sorting. With their enthusiasm, I just hope they'll
leave the castle standing."

"Oh, they're just after some harmless fun. Reminds me of your brothers,
Merlin rest their souls."

"I'll just be happy if they can still their jokes long enough to
concentrate on their school work. Had the toughest time getting them
through their preparatory learning. The only way they'd learn anything
is if it was for fun."

"Nothing wrong with a bit of fun in their lives," Grandmum Prewett
stated. "How is Arthur doing with those Muggle Protection laws the
Wizengamot had him on?"

"Honestly mother," Molly answered with a sigh. "He finished those ages
ago. I owl you every week. You know he's head of the Misuse of Muggle
Artifacts Department now. Finds the most ghastly things that witches
and wizards pass off to muggles. Had an antique tea pot last week that
was laced with Everlasting Sleeping Drought. He had to visit the poor
victim in the hospital to get them out of the coma the muggles thought
them to be in. Came back all excited about the beeps and whistles their
machines made."

"At least you've both found what you love," Mrs. Prewett said, her voice
infused with love and sincerity. She turned to her granddaughter, still
hugged at her side, and asked, "Are you ready to go?"

"Yes, Grandmum."

"If it's alright then, Molly, we'll be going. I think the floo is the
best way, don't you think?"

"Of course," Mrs. Weasley agreed. She then set her eyes authoritatively
on her daughter. "You be good for your grandmum, Ginevra. Don't forget
your table manners."

With an explicit agreement to behave, they were off. Discretely Harry
managed to get behind Ginny, hugging her tight through the invisibility
cloak to get them to the same place with one trip. Luckily no one noticed
that Ginny seemed to take an extra large pinch of floo powder, or that
the flare of green flame that took them from the Burrow was especially
large, or the flutter of the end of the invisibility cloak as it danced
in the harmless flames as they disappeared.

With a kiss on both of Molly's cheeks, Mrs. Weasley's mum bid a final
farewell before following Ginny and her invisible husband, calling out,
"Diagon Alley."

* * *

Upon arriving at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry quickly found his feet and
ducked behind Ginny to remove his cloak without gaining suspicion. It
took a reminder from his wife, however, to get his necklace off. Had he
worn the galaxy through lunch, who knows how poorly the day could have
gone. Mrs. Prewett might have been able to 'see' him, but fat lot of
good it would have done when she couldn't look at him. Harry stuffed the
galaxy in the pocket of his robe with the folded invisibility cloak just
before Mrs. Prewett's entrance through a flare of green flame. Unlike
Ginny and Harry, she maintained her footing elegantly.

The trip through Diagon Alley to the restaurant was quick and easy. Harry
might have wanted to visit some of the shops, but it wasn't the day for
such dalliances. Before he knew it, they were sitting down at a nicely
appointed table with a white table cloth and golden candles.

Suddenly more nervous, Harry began to fill the silent void, "Thank you
for inviting me Mrs. Prewett. I'm sure you must have a lot of questions
about your granddaughter and I, and I want to answer any that you have
to make you feel more comfortable about this. Ginny's been so nice and
all bringing me in to be with her, giving me all the food I could eat
and such a nice place to sleep and..."

Harry was stopped by a raised hand. He looked at the jolly woman, giving
her his full attention as she spoke, "Harry, none of that is necessary
at all right now. First we will enjoy our meal and then we can discuss
such things. Let's hurry now and make our selections before the waiter
comes back with our drinks."

This settled Harry down without fuss. With his limited experience in
situations such as these, Harry relied on mimicking Ginny to the best
of his ability. Seeing Ginny reading her menu, Harry did the same. By
the time the waiter came around with their drinks, Gilly Water for
Mrs. Prewett and pumpkin juice for both Harry and Ginny, Harry had
read the whole menu, but understood little. What descriptions he did
understand, had things that he didn't think of as food. He had seen
ducks in a local lake he was able to visit once with the Dursleys, but
had no idea that anyone caught them and ate them. No, he didn't think
duck would be the best thing to try.

At the other edge of the menu, he was sure the notations were of prices,
but couldn't understand the single number that was listed. Wasn't
wizarding money in three different coins? What would one number alone
mean?

Fortuitously, his dining companions were the first to order, giving Harry
that extra time, but, unfortunately, he had not paid attention to what
they ordered. At the last, Harry finally saw something that he had at
least heard his uncle mention, and that was a godsend.

"Harry..." Ginny said calmly to gain his attention, "It's your turn."

"Oh! I'll have the beef wellington."

"Very good, sir. And how would you like it cooked?"

This reminded Harry of when he had heard of the dish ... at the time,
his uncle had not been impressed with the idea. "What kind of a strange
idea was that," his uncle had complained when the Dursleys had returned
from a company dinner. "Take a good piece of meat and wrap it up in
pastry? At least the cook got it right, medium-rare. Probably would have
been tough otherwise."

"Medium-rare, please," Harry answered quickly.

The salad course arrived quickly, saving Harry from participating in
the conversation, beyond looking interested and engaged. Ginny and
Mrs. Prewett carried the conversation, leaving Harry where he preferred
in his shyness; inconspicuous and quiet.

Lunch's main course arrived shortly, which surprised Harry. He wasn't sure
how long the particular dishes they ordered took to cook, but the things
he cooked for the Dursleys had always taken longer. The table lapsed
into full silence as they all ate their ordered dishes. Soon enough the
plates were finished and gathered by the waiter. Mrs. Prewett asked for
an after lunch tea while their meals settled, promising a special desert
later. Thus, Harry sat knowing the interrogation was about to start.

"Relax, Harry. I'm not about to break out the Spiny Needles Hex. I
just want to get to know you. You are, after all, my granddaughter's
husband. That's not going to change because of this conversation,
let's hope."

"Spiny Needles Hex?"

Ginny grasped his hand in a show of solidarity, offering him comfort
and letting him know he wasn't alone. Mrs. Prewett proceeded on ignoring
the questioning repeat.

"Well, now. I know some things about you because of your fame and the
legends surrounding you, so first," she paused, "let's throw all that
out the window as mindless speculation and inaccurate fairy tales. Tell
me about yourself and your life from when you can first remember."

With that broad request to fulfil, Harry launched into a version of his
childhood. He sanitized it, only alluding to the treatment he received
at the hands of the Dursleys, but told a rather complete tale for not
imparting those things. He paused only for the arriving tea and picked
his tale back up once each of their cups was properly augmented. His
tale finished, all he could do is wait for the response from his
Grandmother-in-law.

Mrs. Prewett, in her turn, wanted nothing more than to just bring the two
children into her arms and tell them it would be all right, but she had
a responsibility to know that he would do what was best for Ginny. Any
signs that everything was actually all right would have to wait until
her duty as a grandmother was satisfied.

"What are your intentions for my granddaughter's life, safety and
happiness?" she asked with a stern face.

Harry didn't respond immediately. In truth, he didn't know how to respond
because he didn't know exactly what was being asked. The question, while
blunt, used concepts that were above the reach of an nine year old,
no matter how mature he seemed.

"I'm...I...what..." Harry stammered and stuttered through trying to
understand and answer. Luckily Ginny decided to speak up.

"What do you mean, Grandmum?"

"Sorry, dears," she apologized. "What I mean to ask is; what will you have
Ginny's role be when you are both grown up? Will she tend house? Will she
have a job? What will your job be? How will you support yourselves? Will
you protect her?"

"Of course I will!" Harry exclaimed. "And as to the rest; what will she
do? I don't know. I reckon she'll do what she wants to do."

"That is a very good attitude, Mr. Potter. I realize that you have no
way of answering or even understanding the questions I asked, which
doesn't surprise me. Tell me, which marriage ritual did you use?"

Harry looked at Ginny to see her reaction. "Do you remember the wording?"

"Yeah, the first time..."

"Wait," Mrs. Prewett interrupted her, "You've already done more than one?"

"Um, yeah," Harry answered. "There was a lot of tension last night and
after Ginny forgave me, we wanted something to make us feel better,
and the first marriage ritual felt so good, we tried another."

"Ah, such a drastic way to feel better after a fight. You'll find better
ways when you are older," she assured them. "So, which rituals?"

"The first one," Ginny said again, pausing where she was interrupted the
first time. "...went, 'I, Ginevra Molly Weasley, do accept the binding
of Harry James Potter with no reservation and do offer the binding of
my love, my heart and my soul in return, with no caveat in voice, mind
or heart.' His lines were the same, only with our names reversed."

Harry was just amazed at her memory to remember the line so well. If
he had to, he might have been able to, but not on the spot like that,
without any doubt.

"Hmm, I've always liked that one," Mrs. Prewett said with a far away
smile. "It was said that my own grandparents, my father's parents,
had such a simple ceremony, using a rope that she braided from her own
locks. May I see your wrists?"

They presented their right wrists to her, letting her examine the flowered
vine that encircled both. "How wonderful. I wasn't aware that there was
any such vine around your parents' house."

"Harry found it in a meadow."

"Enchanted one, I am sure," grandmum Prewett opined. "And the second
ritual? Was there flora involved in this one as well?"

"No," Harry answered. "We were in her room at the Burrow and couldn't
get any more, and the one we used before was still rooting in the planter
outside her window."

"Of course."

"Anyway," Harry said, recalling the second, if for nothing else than to
prove that he also remembered his own weddings. "The second was just
words. 'I, Harry James Potter, do take Ginevra Molly Weasley to be my
wedded wife, to honour, support and cherish, in sickness and in health,
for richer or poorer, for as long as we both shall live. ' Like the first
one, there was a flash of light and a warm feeling after we both said it."

"An old rite," Mrs. Prewett informed them. "Goes back many
centuries. There are many older ones, like your first, but that one
was before traditions changed in the wizarding world." Seeing a curious
and interested look in both of their faces she continued, "These days,
another line was added to that ritual, 'forsaking all others,' which
is in the muggle one as well, if I remember correctly. Centuries ago,
a lord in the wizarding realm could take multiple wives. Of course,
that really died out long before Hogwarts and long before that ritual,
but it left the door open anyway, until a century or more ago, when it
became practice to add the line. It's not always done, but that's why it
was added. I'm glad the second rite worked. It could have failed because
of the names you use. By any right, Ginny's new name should be Ginevra
Molly Potter."

"Really? Could that make the ritual fail?" Ginny asked.

"Not the one you've already performed, but it could complicate any more
that you do, if there are more."

"You seem to know so much about these things!" Harry complimented. "You
must be some sort of expert. Is that what you do for a living?"

"No, no. I always kept the house and raised the children. I never had a
job like my husband did, but ceremonies such as these have always caught
my interest."

"Can you recommend more of them for us, just in case we want more?" Harry
asked.

"More? Haven't you had enough?" she joked. "I certainly can. Why?"

"The first and second felt good and were fun," Ginny answered. "Plus,
maybe they won't send Harry away if..."

"I'm sure they won't," Harry comforted her. "We're married now."

"Well, even so, between just those two rituals you are certainly not going
to be split up," she said with a chuckle. After a breath, her demeanour
changed. She became more serious, but also more like a wise mentor,
leaning forward and connecting with both of them, eye to eye. "Let's
be serious, now. You've stepped into a lifelong situation here. At
this point in your lives you probably can't even understand that much,
but just remember this; this is for the rest of your lives. You will
be together for the rest of your lives. Grow up together. Live, love,
learn together, but always remember that your spouse comes first. For
you, Harry, Ginny should always be your first consideration. What is
best for her . And you, Ginny, your first consideration should be what
is best for your husband, Harry. Even before your brothers and parents,
your duty is to your husband, just as his is to you."

Ginny and Harry sat quietly and absorbed as much of what she was telling
them as they could understand. What made it through was what needed to,
and they had no doubt, in their young age, that they would do as she
commanded. With age and experience, maybe they would have seen bumps
and not been so sure of themselves, but then again, love has a way of
making any blind to the rocky roads ahead.

"Enough of that flap," Mrs. Prewett clapped her hands. "What say you
two to some cake for such an occasion?"

* * *

Travelling back was just as difficult as the trip out. Mrs. Prewett
went first to cover the way, with Harry and Ginny following together,
just as before. They arrived in the middle of a chess game between
Ron and his father, the elder at an advantage, but not by considerable
margins. Harry and Ginny could both see that this was their sixth game,
Mr. Weasley with three figurines and Ron with two, a sixth sitting on
the side of the board between the two players awaiting the winner. For as
long as the oldest child could remember, Mr. Weasley used the figurines
to encourage the children to engage in group activities, redeeming them
after the game for biscuits or some other treat. Molly would just shake
her head, but it was all in fun. The biscuits would be eaten in the end
whether they were given away as prizes or sneaked from the jar.

They had returned from lunch with just a few hours before the party was
to start for the 'formal' celebration of Ginny's birthday. Ginny hugged
her grandmum with a wide smile, greatly encouraged by the fact that she
had accepted Harry with open arms, when she didn't have to.

"Thank you for lunch, Grandmum."

"You're welcome, Ginevra. Happy birthday."

Ginny split off with a final squeeze of her hug. Her mum was up off the
couch ready in her place. Quietly, Ginny heard, "Thank you for taking
her to lunch, Mum. Did you have a good time?"

"Oh, yes. It was most interesting and entertaining. So mature she's
getting."

"Yes, she is. She met a boy at a shop a bit ago and heard about his home
life and wanted to take him home. Begged and pleaded for weeks afterwards
for us to check up on him. We made the inquiries, but, really, one boy
named Harry in all of England, there was little chance. But she still
cared. I do hope that it turned out all right for that boy."

"I'm sure it will. Now, I must be going. Tuckered me out today."

"You aren't staying for the party?" Molly asked. Hearing that his
mother-in-law was leaving, Arthur told his chessmen to stand down for a
bit, while he got up for a stretch. Harry was amused to see the knights
and rooks calling out to him, questioning his dedication to the battle,
while the pawns seemed to be unrolling bedrolls or setting up for a
meal. Where two white pawns were next to each other, they seemed content
to share duties. The black pieces seemed to be staring Ron down, waiting
for their leave.

"Okay, fine, but we're coming back to this, so don't forget where
you are!" Ron reminded his pieces. He, too, made his way toward the
fireplace. There he joined the queue of his brothers saying 'goodbye'
to their grandmum.

After finishing her own goodbye, Ginny proceeded up the stairs, away from
the rest of the family, knowing that the right person would be following
her. Once inside the room, Harry wrapped his arms around her from behind,
giving her an absolute feeling of comfort.

"Happy Birthday, Ginny."

"Thank you, Harry. And I did love your gift. I think we'll enjoy it."

"Good," he said, allowing her to turn to face him. "Now what will we do
until you have to go to your party?"

"Well, I think it'll be expected that I spend time with my brothers,
so, I don't know..."

"I wanted to spend time with you, but you probably should spend time
with your brothers. I'll just be under the cloak, nearby."

"Just be up here for a bath at around five. I need to be ready for the
party and I can't have my bath without my husband."

"Of course," Harry said, placing a kiss on her cheek through the cloak.

Downstairs, Ginny went straight to her dad and gave him a hug, which
didn't make him suspicious at all. After all, she was a physically
affectionate child. However, she had learned how to get what she wanted
from her father, just as any little girl was apt to learn. On this
occasion, what she wanted was a wand. Among wizarding families, there are
many games for children that involved magic, which, naturally, required
an adult to part with their wand. Any wands from the school age children
could have set off sensors in the Ministry of Magic's Improper Use of
Magic Office, and it was an unwritten rule amongst the purebloods not to
bring any attention of that office where their offspring was concerned,
making it easier for the Ministry to ignore any early or extra training
given to the young.

"Daddy," Ginny said in as innocent voice as she could. "Can we use your
wand for a game outside?"

Mr. Weasley, who had been in a conversation with Mrs. Weasley, smiled at
his little girl and briefly hugged her shoulders to his abdomen. "Now,
Pumpkin, you remember what happened last time you used my wand for those
games of yours. You turned Percy green and Fred turned Ron's clothes
into a dress. We can't have accidents happening."

"But, dad..." she whined in return.

"And you know better than to use Charlie's or Percy's. And no using
Bill's wand for the same reason as mine, you could have accidents. Ask
you mum to let you use your Great Great Uncle Wyferus's wand."

"But, dad. It hardly works for any of us at all! It's such a pain to use."

"And that is why I'll let you use it. It's good enough to shoot sparks
out of, and, unless you've changed the game since I was your age, that
is all you need to play wand tag."

What she didn't want to tell him is that they had changed the game. The
original had the person who was 'It' using the 'It Wand', which was just a
wand with a bright red ribbon tied around it, to chase down the others and
try to shoot them with sparks. The common sparks that any wizarding child
knows how to shoot would shoot straight for some distance before fading
out. If they hit someone, they would explode harmlessly, showering sparks
in all directions, rather than just straight from the wand. It made good
visual evidence that a person was struck. The person struck would then be
'It' and would be given the 'It Wand' to begin chasing the others once
again. The game, as it was played the previous summer by the children
had them casting a slightly different spark that Charlie taught them
which left coloured marks on the person, be it their clothes or their
skin. The marks would eventually fade, but was great fun for children
while they lasted. The only problem was that the sparks Charlie taught
them would not work from their Great Great Uncle's old wand. The man had
used a vinewood wand with a core from the spinal cord of a Cornish Pixie;
a wand combination that would do little but sparks for anyone else,
leaving one to wonder how he came across such a wand in the first place.

Ginny, knowing that it would probably be the best they could do, turned
to her mum and asked for the wand. Molly would never refuse now that her
husband had already just about given permission. She may have talked to
him later, had she not agreed, especially for her daughter's birthday.

"I'll get it in a second, honey. Why don't you gather the others and
see who wants to play."

With a 'thank you' to both her parents, Ginny ran off to gather all of her
brothers. Each of them agreed to play up in the orchard where the trees
would make the game more interesting. Even the reserved Percy agreed to
play after Ginny put the heavy persuasion to him. He, like his brothers,
could not resist when there was something Ginny truly wanted.

They all gathered outside the kitchen, next to the garden, where Bill
and Charlie reiterated the 'rules' of the game with such things as;
'no tag backs', 'no running to mum if someone manages to shoot something
other than sparks' (this one with sharp looks to Ron and Percy), 'no
peeking while you count to ten' and 'no fast counting! Say '1 Cauldron
Cake, 2 Cauldron Cake, etc.', 'but Charlie that just makes me hungry for
cauldron cakes,' Ron would complain and Bill would tell him, 'fine, say 1
clauricorn, 2 clauricorn,' ,'What's a clauricorn?', 'It's a leprechaun,'
,'Why can't I say l 'leprechaun' then?' ,'Say whatever you want, as long
as it's a long enough word that you aren't counting too fast.'

As soon as Mrs. Weasley retrieved the wand from where ever it was stashed,
the whole group took off as a whole for the orchard at an excited
jog. When they got up there and prepared to start, Ginny kept the wand
and declared she was 'It' first. This made Ron shudder at the thought of
his sister with a wand in her hand chasing after him and his brothers,
no matter how ineffective the wand was supposed to be. Harry placed
himself outside the action where he could see somewhat, but wouldn't
get struck by the sparks shot at one of the others. Even if a tree were
struck, the sparks would not explode as they would if it hit a person,
and Harry was taking no chances that he would be struck and lit up in
his invisibility. He wouldn't trust the others to not notice, even if
he did have the galaxy around his neck still.

The antics he saw made him laugh, which was luckily covered by the
laughter of the rest of the children. Ginny being the first shooter,
Harry counted at least ten shots of red and purple sparks before Percy
was lit up like Guy Fawkes Day. The next time Ginny was 'It', after Ron
had been 'It' twice and Charlie had yet to have been hit, Harry could
have sworn that Ginny hit both of the twins and Bill at the same time,
sending out all three shots in quick succession. At five o'clock Harry
carefully made his way to his wife and placed his invisible hand on her
shoulder to gain her attention without facing the 'It Wand', which was
in her hand for the fourth time that afternoon. He whispered the time
in her ear, to which she gave a small nod. She quickly shot Charlie,
who had come from behind a tree to her right to find shelter further from
his sister. She quickly begged off, saying she had to take a bath before
the party, hinting also that they could use some cleaning up as well.

* * *

The bath was just as it always was, with both Ginny and Harry getting
themselves clean and having some fun along the way. They got out in
time for the boys to do a quick wash-up before the guests arrived. At
the party, Ginny was able to say hello to some cousins, uncles and
aunts. She had already opened her gifts from each of them, but enjoyed
the cake after blowing out the candles that floated above the icing.

That night, Ginny and Harry snuggled under the light blanket on her bed
happily. Neither wanted anything to change at that point.

The next morning was punctuated by owls and letters. While Percy was
poring over his book list, including for the first time, a list of books
for his electives, Fred and George were dancing arm in arm, spinning
around the table, generally making a ruckus.

"We got our letters! We got our letters!" they chanted and sang over
and over. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry would never be the
same. Fred and George Weasley had been accepted as first year students.
