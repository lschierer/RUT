I finished *[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince][grhp6]* tonight. It was a very good
book.  Much of it was happy and amusing, yet more-so than the previous books, it
has ended on a sad note. Yet somehow that fits.  I do hope that Ginny is smart
and stubborn enough to stick with Harry.  Once I rather wanted Harry and
Hermione to end up together, yet this book managed to make me comfortable with
her and Ron, and Harry and Ginny.  I think the last book did its part in that as
well.
