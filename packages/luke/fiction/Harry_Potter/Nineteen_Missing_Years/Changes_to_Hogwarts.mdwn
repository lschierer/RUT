[[!meta title="Changes to Hogwarts After the War"]]

As best I can tell, [[Dumbledore|Notes/adults/Dumbledore]] was Headmaster of
[[Hogwarts|Notes/Hogwarts]] for somewhat over forty years.[^211028-2]  We are
unsure how long he was Deputy Headmaster before that, and in what state he
"inherited" control of the school.  Irregardless, the consensus is that changes
were necessary after the war.  There is much less consensus on what those
changes look like, how successfully they were implemented, and by whom.

The available secondary information on her strongly suggests that she was
appointed Headmistress in the immediate aftermath of the final battle, and
remained in that role for at least the next twenty-one years.[^211028-3]  

What *kind* of Headmistress was she?  Did she seek to perpetuate
[[Dumbledore|Notes/adults/Dumbledore]]'s policies?[^211028-4]  Can she crack
down on discipline without changing the very nature of
[[Hogwarts|Notes/Hogwarts]]?[^211028-5]  In either case, I do *not* think that
she would support disbanding the House structure entirely, nor Slytherin house
specifically.  In the first place, I do not think that there is reason to
disband the House structure, as I imply as I look at
[[Hogwarts|Notes/Hogwarts]], Houses seem to be a staple part of life at most
boarding secondary schools across the United Kingdom.  Given you are going to
have Houses at all, lets be proud of our tradition and keep our Houses named for
Founders (as that too seems common), but reform relationships and the nature of
the sorting itself.  

Slytherin is to be the house of ambition and cunning.  Neither of those is a
trait restricted to those of one lineage.  If we get rid of legacy house
placements, and install a zero tolerance for prejudice and bullying, we can
actually sort people where they belong.  Do Crabbe or Goyle show any ambition or
cunning for example?  Just by breaking up "traditional" placements we can
probably do much to reform the relationships between the houses.
