based on Ms. Felicitie C. Bell, Mr. Michael L. Miller.  "[Life Tables for the United States Social Security Area 1900-2100](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_studies/study120.pdf)" 2005-08. SSA Pub. No. 11-11536. 
I'm using 1900's US numbers essentially because 1) I do not have UK numbers 2)
1900's numbers seams to me a reasonable average between the effects of the magic
that nephil would use (cooling charms, preservation charms, medical charms and
potions), versus their tendency to ignore non-magical advances in science after
the statute of secrecy.  

Looking at the above, Euphemia should have had a life expectancy of around 108
years and Fleamont of around 125 years, yet they had James at around 68 and died
at around 87.  The first says that magic is extending fertility as well as
lifespan.  The second says that these are *average* numbers, and that there are
still magical diseases that can drastically shorten them (since we know they
died of dragon pox).
