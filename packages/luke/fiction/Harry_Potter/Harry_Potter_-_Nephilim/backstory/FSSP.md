The Priestly Fraternity of St Peter is real,[^211219-4] as is the Parish of St
John Fisher.[^211219-5]  I am asserting a couple of historical fictions.  I have
moved the parish from Reading to Little Whinging Surrey, and I have moved it back
in time from 2007 or so to roughly 1989.  

This is problematic in a couple of senses, but necessary for the story.

1. The real FSSP was not established until 1988.[^211219-6]
2. The real FSSP was not active in the UK until 1998.[^211219-7]

However, given my [[AU Rules|fiction/Harry_Potter_-_Nephilim]], it makes much
more sense that it would be an order dedicated to things traditional that would
remember the (fictional) nephilim.  

For the purposes of this universe, the FSSP was established a decade earlier
than real life.  In 1988 instead of being newly created *anywhere*, it is given
a parish in the UK more or less as an experiment by the local bishop on behalf
of the bishop's conference, who are considering inviting FSSP to England to help
them deal with fallen away Catholics who may be drawn to the old Rite.  Thus the
bulk of their British activity will not start until a later date more in line
with real history.  This will also explain why the FSSP priests in this story
feel constrained in their ability to deal with Harry's situation.  They do not
want to make waves before they are formally established in the diocese.
