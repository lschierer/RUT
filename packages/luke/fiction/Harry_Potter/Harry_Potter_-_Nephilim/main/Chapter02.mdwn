Harry's prioritisation of the spiritual over the physical exposed him to his
mother's love; it also exposed him to Voldemort's hate.  On the whole though,
the knowledge that he was in fact loved was a net positive, and like Lily
hoped, the depression spiral ceased.  *Unfortunately* it came at a cost.
Divided from himself, and as young as he was, Harry was not really even
aware of the things in the physical world that he was missing.  The things
that should have held his attention, many of the things that he should have
been learning.  Neither Lily, who wanted her son to be healthy out of love,
nor Voldemort who looked at Harry's body as a conquest, the future young
Tom Riddle, wanted him stunted in terms of learning things like walking,
getting dressed, bathing and other activities of daily living.  Thus even
as they fought, there was an unspoken truce and Lily was allowed to work
with Harry to teach him to manipulate his almost remote-controlled body just
enough to survive.  Vernon would not allow the boy to thrive.

But teaching Harry required legilimency, which always comes at a cost, even to
the target.  This cost started to become apparent in Harry's fourth year.
Harry's dreams started to become periodically confused, invaded by strange
sights of strangely distorted forests, where all the plants and trees seemed
weirdly over sized.  Harry could knot know, and Lily did not have the science
background to know that this distortion came from the differences between human
and reptilian eyes - Harry was seeing, in his dreams, as if he were the main
piece of Voldemort,[^20210917-2] currently possessing a snake in the forests of
Albania.  Harry's magic had changed.  He had longed for years to connect to
someone alive the way he had felt connected to the bright soul when she taught
him things.  Now, triggered by the chaotic mutations that come from excess
exposure to active legilimency, his magic was actively seeking to make such a
connection.  A young child's magic is generally called accidental for a reason
though, something that is even worse before the child reaches the age of reason.
Harry was not in control of this questing for connection, it was simply
happening.  Awake, anytime his magic came even close to the soul shard, the
sense of evil repelled him, but his sleeping mind, troubled by nightmares,
sometimes sensed the shard's desire for Harry, and in part because Harry was
asleep (and thus not thinking rationally at all) and in part because he was only
four (and thus even more not capable of rational thought), mistaking the shard's
desire to take over Harry's body for a desire to be *with* Harry.  

Fortunately for now the bizarre connection was both short lived and only went
one way.  Harry's dreaming self got lost in the mutilated soul of Tom Riddle.
On waking however, the feeling of wrongness shattered the bridge forming between
them before it could solidify into something permanent.  Meanwhile the part of
Riddle in Harry was ignorant of the connection Harry's magic periodically
attempted to form.  The shard in Harry was focused on Lily; the majority of it
in the snake was limited by the snake's limited animal brain, and thus struggled
with complex thought (for thought is always affected by the physical brain a
soul inhabits).  Thus Riddle gained no extra knowledge of a sleeping boy in
Surrey England.

Aunt Petunia may not have actively hated him, but she certainly did not want
to be reminded of her sister more than was really necessary.  As Harry grew
and learned to be more self sufficient, he also learned to be more and more
introverted and silent.  It was better that way.  Being rarely seen and
never heard was the best way to avoid Vernon's ire, Dudley's bored abuse,
and even annoying Aunt Petunia with a disconcerting green stare.

Children are remarkably resilient, and magical children even more so, but by
this time, Harry was going months without talking. There was simply no one for
him to really talk to on any regular basis.  Lily's lack of any real sense
of time was acting against him, this was not someone actively harming him,
it was just a gradual lack of activity.  Atrophy of the vocal cords and the
muscles around them is something that doctors usually only see, if they see
it at all, in the elderly.  Children normally either have or create plenty of
opportunity to talk and thus exercise their voices.  Harry was quickly falling
into that rare exception case, unfortunately there was no one to notice as his
voice became breathy and high pitched, even for a young child.  Having learned
within weeks that crying out just caused problems, Harry never tried for high
volume, so no one noticed that it was less and less possible for him to yell.
He so rarely said anything more than "thank you Aunt Petunia." or "Yes Uncle
Vernon" that his vocal fatigue went unremarked, even by himself.[^20201214-2]

Having heard from his spy, Arabella Figg, Dumbledore had worried that this
effectively undocumented child might make waves in muggle society and had
taken steps to prevent that.  As Harry started school that fall[^20210208-2],
teachers would take notice of the small boy in ill fitting clothing who
could barely talk, but then would forget before they would remember to file
official reports about it.[^20210706-3]

As Dudley was exposed to a wider audience, Petunia and Vernon needed a new
form of denial to deal with the resulting problems.  Reports that Dudley was
a bully got transferred to Harry in their minds, and when they subconsciously
realised that might not be sufficient, Petunia started a campaign to have
the neighbourhood blame Harry for Dudley's misdeeds as well.  Up until this
point Petunia could honestly say she did not hate Harry.  But as she convinced
herself that he was a miscreant, bullying other children and causing problems
for Dudley in school, she turned against him.  There was really no choice.
The alternative was to face up to the disaster that was her own son.
She could not do that.

In his first year of school, Reception, Harry happened to honestly be sick
and miss class the day they had a presentation about talking to adults
about abuse.  It never occurred to him to do so spontaneously.  In his
second year of school, he tried, but was disappointed - the teacher could
not remember their conversation the next day.  Indeed, she barely seemed to
remember *him* at all. Something odd was clearly going on.  Harry noticed,
and more, Lily noticed.

It took some time.  She could not spare much magic for diagnostic spells,
and even when she could, she would forget just how quickly time was passing
for Harry.  He kept asking though, and eventually Lily realised that
someone official had placed some variant of the spells that prevent humans
from noticing the Leaky Cauldron or Platform 9Â¾ on the area.  The number of
people who could have done so, would have done so, was vanishingly small.
A "muggle-born" herself, she knew there was no reason for the Ministry of
Magic to have be-spelled a random muggle home, even if it did happen to house a
young wizard.  It had to have something to do with his placement with the
Dursleys instead of with Sirius or the Longbottoms as her Will had specified
should have happened.

That her son's enemies could act with such immunity meant that her plans were
going to have to change.  Harry was learning that he could not trust anyone.
As he came in contact with more and more people only to find that they joined
in with the Dursleys rather than helping him, or even staying neutral, his
faith in humanity was taking a blow. If Lily did not want her son to become
cynical and embittered, something would have to be done.  It was time to teach
Harry true legilimency, so that he could understand what makes people tick,
and start to separate the evil from the weak, and to find the good even when
they feel helpless and scared.  Even just knowing their emotions, she would be
able to help Harry understand when they acted on fear versus anger, greed, or
selfishness.  She knew that actively accessing their thoughts was a step she
must not, *could not* in fact[^20210208-1], help Harry take, such an act was
always a violation, but surely building just a little on his existing abilities
would not hurt; purely passive legilimency could be done without a cost, right?
Thus, as she was teaching him, she was careful to guide him away from Petunia
and Dudley's memories, and to focus him on the areas where a nephil differs
little from the human.  Harry, excited by the wealth of information, and more by
the potential safety that information offered, did not notice that anything even
*was* different between the two of them and Vernon.  

Lily did not realise whether she was making a mistake.  Using legilimency
solely to read emotions might be morally neutral, but the act of teaching
Harry *anything* was also, accidentally, but very effectively, teaching him
to communicate using legilimency.  It was not *what* she was teaching so much as
the fact that she had to herself use legilimency to do it.  It would be a small
step from using magic to communicate between two souls in one head to
communicate between two minds existing as actually separate persons.  Lily would
never have intentionally taught Harry to use legilimency in this fashion.  Sure
it was only wrong if forced, but it was *always* risky.  It *always* invited
unpredictable effects.  Harry was already experiencing that, and would learn
more about those risks the hard way.

[^20210917-2]: I know that in the actual Harry Potter books, this connection has
    a different explanation.  Frankly the way Mrs. Rowling did things does not
    fully make sense, If Lily's protection lived on in Harry, then we need a
    *reason* for Riddle's soul to be able to both latch on and, even more,
    affect Harry the way we see happen.  I'm providing that here. 

[^20210706-3]: The idea that magic is being used to prevent people from noticing
    Harry's situation is not original here, it occurs in birdwoman95's _[The Sound
    Of Silence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12175260)_ and other works.  

[^20201214-2]: look up presbylaryngis for where I got this idea. It is primarily
    age related, but from what I read, can happen for other reasons.  I realise
    this is *extremely* unlikely.
