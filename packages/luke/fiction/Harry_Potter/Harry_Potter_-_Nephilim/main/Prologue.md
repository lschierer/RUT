[[!trailitem Chapter01]]

While Lily Potter had excelled in potions, she had been a charms
prodigy.[^20210902-6]  Her husband, James, had been as skilled at
transfiguration as she had been at charms, and the two of them had competed
for top honours in Defence against the Dark arts.[^20210902-7]  James had
struggled in Ancient Runes, which had come naturally to Lily, and so it was that
she took the lead in researching protective measures when they learned that
Voldemort[^20210902-8] was targeting their infant son.  The accepted wisdom is
that there is no defence against the killing curse, and having faced *him* three
times, both knew the "unforgivable" curses to be particular favourites of his.
There was no doubt in either mind it was this curse they needed to defend their
son against.

The Potter family was an old one, the first recorded magical Potter was from
the twelfth century, which is respectable, even in wizarding terms.  What is
not well known that they had inherited the legacy of the Peverell family.
If you asked the Blacks or the Notts, or even the Macmillans or Longbottoms,
you would probably be told that the Gaunts were the heirs of the Peverells.
The Potters, very quietly, knew better.[^20210218-2] The eldest Peverell
brother had died, murdered in his sleep, childless and thus without an heir.
The Gaunt family has always claimed to be descended from both the Slytherin
Family and the Gaunt family, and have used the Peverell ring and Slytherin's
locket as proof of this claim.  Their claim is that the ring is a signet
ring, which might hold some weight if it had come from Antioch, the elder
brother, but not from Cadmus, the middle brother.  To those who truly know,
it is the cloak, not the ring, that goes to the heir of the Peverell family,
as it is the third son, Ignotus, who alone lived long enough to have and raise
children.  Following in Ignotus' footsteps, the Potters allow the Gaunts to
claim credit as the Peverell heir.  Let them paint a target on their backs.
The Potters have something far more important - the Peverell library that,
like the cloak, can be used to protect the family.

In the muggle world, scientists share their results, each building on
those who have come before.  The magical world works quite differently,
which perhaps explains why it so often stagnates.  In the magical world,
families hoard knowledge and share it out with schools like Hogwarts only
when there is a clear benefit to do so, usually a quid pro quo between
some of the great families.[^20210420-1] The Potters may be just barely old
enough to be respectable, but the Peverells are *ancient*.  The Potters have
eight centuries of accumulated knowledge; the Peverell family was old and famous
when it *ended* as the Potters *began*.  No one outside the family knows how
many centuries of knowledge the Peverell Library adds to the Potter Library.
It is this combined Library that Lily had at her finger tips, using magical
access (to keep the actual Library secure and hidden), as she and James fled
with Harry from refuge to refuge before finally settling behind the fidelus.
And after months of research, she had something.  It was massively theoretical.
Nothing *quite* like it had ever been tried.  But it *should* work. It
came a hideous cost, but nothing was more important than Harry's survival.
She talked it over with James, and they both agreed.  The stage was set.
If the worst came to the worst, if the fidelus failed them, if somehow
they were found, ... each wrote letters, left in the family vault, so that
hopefully Harry would grow up knowing something of them no matter what.

James was playing with Harry in the living room.  Lily came in, and took
Harry off to bed.  James felt the thin thread of magic they had left snap
as the gate opened.  That would only happen if someone unknown, unexpected
entered the property, something that should not happen, could not happen,
unless Peter had betrayed them.  The worst had come.  It was time to play his
part.  It would take consummate acting, or Voldemort would suspect something.
He dropped his wand on the couch and stretched as if he suspected nothing
- as if he felt safe, secure.  When the door burst open, he charged down
the hall, yelling for Lily (as if she did not already know and were not
already drawing the necessary runes on Harry), leaving his wand behind as
if by accident. He had to move fast.  If Voldemort had any time at all, he
would realise that the idea that James would forget his wand was ridiculous.
But the expected flash of green came, and James let it.  Let his sacrifice,
walking (well, running, but same thing) willingly to his death, power the
protection Lily was even now preparing.

Lily finished drawing the runes on Harry, using her saliva, so that they would
not show, so that Voldemort would have no clue they were there.  It was hair
raising work, it would be so easy to make a mistake because just as *he*
could not see them, *she* could barely tell what she was doing as well.
Fortunately it only took a couple of runes across his forehead.  As the door
to the nursery burst, like the door to the house had moments before, she
placed herself between the crib and the monster bent on destroying her family.
She begged for Harry's life, trilled that they had guessed right.  Voldemort had
promised her to that creep who had once been her friend, Severus.  She would
have her chance.  As expected, Voldemort lost patience, and the green light
flashed.  She felt unbelievable pain as her soul was ripped from her body.
James' sacrifice was not, however, in vain.  She did not pass on.  Her soul,
invisible, untainted by the dark magic that she had steadfastly refused to
use in life, continued to "stand" between her son and the monster.  As the
green light flashed again, it hit her, not Harry.  But she was already dead;
it could not kill her again.  It bounced back, and hit Voldemort.

That was when it went wrong.  It did not kill him.  It shattered his soul,
which *was* tainted, unbelievably tainted, by unbelievably dark magic,
and so *was* visible as a dark cloud.  Much of the shattered soul reformed
and fled.  One sliver however struck her, pushed her back, and together
they fell immaterially against Harry.  The runes that attracted her, that
helped anchor her to form the most effective shield for her son, now worked
against her.  The shard, eager to take control of her son's body, hijacked
the runes.  It was all she could do to stay in between - to ensure that the
shard could not possess her son.  A battle of wills and of magic began.

[^20210902-6]: Per my initial [[notes|Harry_Potter_-_Nephilim]], one of the key
    aspects of this universe is that I was fairly mathematical about magic.
    Thus the most pivotal characters need a breakdown of their abilities.
