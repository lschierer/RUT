This Chapter continues Year 5.  In this Chapter Harry takes a different route
home from school and takes refuge in a Catholic Church run by the
[[FSSP|backstory/FSSP]].  Given his invisibility,
this is probably weather related, though I may change that.  The FSSP priest
assigned to the parish *is able to see him,* at least within the Church, I am
undecided about outside it.
