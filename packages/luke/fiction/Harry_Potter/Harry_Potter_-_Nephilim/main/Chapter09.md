In the cannon world, Chapter Six (the train) is 25 pages and Chapter Seven (the
sorting and feast) is another 18.  A lot of critical stuff happens in these
chapters, some of which I have to change.  For now assume this is just Chapter
Six. How does Harry find the platform?  He needs to end up in a compartment with
Susan & Hannah, not Ron.  Can children see him, or is he only functionally
invisible to adults?  Has this gradually changed due to continued
[[Legilimency|Notes/The_Mind_Arts/Legilimency]]? I think this last, they cannot
see him.  Decide on uniforms, this has a *lot* of implications.
