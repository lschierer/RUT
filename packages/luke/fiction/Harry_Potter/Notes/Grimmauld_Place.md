12 Grimmauld Place is said to be the ancestral home of the [[Black
family|Families]].  This is curious in a couple of respects.  

* Why would the notoriously bigoted [[Blacks|Families]] *want* a house owned by
  someone non-magical in the first place?[^211020-1] We are told they think of
  themselves as some sort of wizarding nobility,[^211020-2] they should desire
  an old manner house or castle, not a relatively modern town house. 
* The house is oddly animated.  We do not *really* know to what extent that is
  normal for magical homes, but the idea that
  [[Walburga|People/ppl/7/5/ed593a34ede574f91fbbf5f2957/]]'s portrait can open
  curtains, resist those curtains being closed, and refuse commands from the
  house's owner seems like more than would be tolerated.[^211020-3]

Lots of fan fiction authors have either insisted that [[James
Potter|adults/James]]'s mother must be [[Dorea
Black|People/ppl/8/e/ed59555dc3943ebf101e8eb4be8/]], or similarly placed in the
[[family tree|Families]] to explain how it is possible for [[Harry]] to inherit
the house.  The [[Harry Potter Wiki]] has a simpler and better explanation: the
English Common Law concept of the [Entailed Estate][wEE1].[^211020-4]  If there
are no male Blacks living, and the house was entailed to the male line, then the
entail is broken and Sirius is free to pass the house on tho whomever he desires
in his will.  *Perhaps* the will could be challenged if Sirius had willed the
house to someone entirely unrelated, but he is [[Harry]]'s god-father and thus
(were he free to assume the role) legal guardian.  In the absence of an immediate
family of his own, providing a legacy for his ward and god-child is expected and
natural.

### More on [[Walburga|People/ppl/7/5/ed593a34ede574f91fbbf5f2957/]]'s Portrait

Are wizards so short sighted that it never occurred to them to destroy the
Portrait in some way, given it cannot be moved?

* It is possibly shielded.[^211020-5]
* It is possibly on a load-bearing wall, and so the wall it is on cannot be
  physically destroyed.[^211020-6]
* She may have bound her soul to it in a pseudo-[[horcrux|Horcruxes]]y
  way.[^211020-7] This may give it some of the same protections from harm.
