This passage has bothered me over and over again, beyond what I can fully
justify and well beyond what I can support with canonical references.  

It basically comes down to two facts.  

The first is the common saying, commonly misattributed to Joseph Goebbels, "If
you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to
believe it."  This is not the only place we hear Snape claiming that Harry is "a
determined rule-breaker," "arrogant", or "attention-seeking."  Indeed these
claims will come up over and over again.  

The second fact is that the teachers *do* treat Harry oddly.
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] claims they find him "modest," and "likeable"
but [[McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]] will have no trouble believing that he has
lured both Malfoy and Neville out of bounds after hours, *and found it funny.*
That is so at odds with his actual personality, that, as I note when I discuss
her character, one wonders who exactly she is punishing.  [[Professor
Sprout|adults/Sprout]] will also have no trouble believing that this "modest"
boy was so "attention-seeking" that he put his own name into the Goblet of Fire
- hence she treats him coldly after his name comes out.[^20210901-2]  Note, that
is before the first Skeeter interview, so it is not the lack of media attention
on Cedric that is at fault. 

You can even find examples where [[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] may be showing
some signs of suspicion. Yes, each of these can be explained away as trying to
gain [[Harry]]'s trust, going through the motions of being impartial, or
similar.  The point is that the above passage is from *very early* in
[[Harry]]'s first year, probably before Halloween, else
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] would know that [[Snape|adults/Snape]] is
already keeping a close eye on Quirrell.  How many times can even
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] hear how arrogant [[Harry]] is before it begins
to, at least a little, influence his thinking?  Especially when we know that
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] was *particularly* concerned that [[Harry]]
grow up away from fame and the ego it would engender?  

In the series that starts with _[Harry Potter: Lost][B12HPL1]_, Bear12 portrays
a universe in which the magical world thinks that [[Harry]] has died, and a
young boy who thinks of himself as "Adam Winters" comes to [[Hogwarts]] as a
homeless orphan.[^20210901-3]  As the series progresses, this version of
[[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] picks up on every single way in which "Adam"
\([[Harry]]\) resembles a young [[Tom Riddle|adults/Riddle]], sometimes even
only remotely.  This makes [[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] suspicious.  In the
"real" series, the "real" [[Harry]] also resembled [[Tom Riddle|adults/Riddle]]
in some key ways.  Add in [[Snape|adults/Snape]] effectively (though
unconsciously, since I do not think [[Snape|adults/Snape]] knows who [[Tom
Riddle|adults/Riddle]] became) emphasising those similarities …
