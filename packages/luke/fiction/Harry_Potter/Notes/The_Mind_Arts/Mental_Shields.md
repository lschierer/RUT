Muggledad in _Partners_[^20191119-7] offers a viable alternative.

> What you will do for Occlumency is to cast a wordless, wandless, and most
  importantly, incantationless shield about your mind and thoughts. It is very
  difficult to do when one's mind is cluttered with the humdrum of day to day
  life, so the calmness and unity of thought that is a byproduct of the Magicus
  Intimus is a vital first step.[^20191119-6]

_At first_ you will find it next to impossible to cast a shield while thinking
about other things.  _At first_ it is thus necessary to practice [[Occlumency]],
short term.  But with practice, you can hold this shield while going about your
normal life just like you walk and chew gum.  You might, with practice, even be
able to walk, chew gum, and catch a baseball, but you will have trouble chewing
gum and taking a drink.  So too, you can, with practice, hold that shield and do
other things.

Here it gets messy.  When [[Professor Snape|adults/Snape]] is focusing on
[[legilimency]], which is closely related to [[occulumency]], he is vulnerable to
[[Harry]] reflecting the attack and breaking into his own mind.[^20191119-8]  Is
this because he used [[occlumency]], or because the same would be true of mental
shields?  

Whichever he is doing, he feels the need to remove certain memories then because
he, effectively, cannot chew gum and drink at the same time.  He can do
[[legilimency]], or he can do &lt;insert art here&gt;, and he can even switch
between them relatively fast, but not fast enough to feel confident about
keeping all his most sensitive memories in his head.  This is an explanation
that makes sense, without going all crazy supper powered about the benefits of
mental defences.
