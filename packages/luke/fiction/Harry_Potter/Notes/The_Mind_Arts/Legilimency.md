Legilimency is the art, Legilimens is the person who practices it. 

Legilimency might not be quite reading your thoughts like a book, but it
certainly seems to come close.  Though I have not seen it myself, this
is apparently especially true if you include the _Fantastic Beasts and
Where To Find Them_ movie.[^20200630-8] According to what I have read,
Mrs. Rowling's comments on that movie indicate that Legilimency is not
just a skill you can learn, but one that you can essentially be born with.

Before reading that, my thoughts were certainly trending in the direction
of the dark arts. The fact that [[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] makes fairly
free use of Legilimency[^20200630-9] is really more proof of the morally
ambiguous nature of [[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]]; I am the last person to
whitelist a practice just because he does it.  Certainly the idea of intruding
on a person's thoughts, memories and emotions is invasive.  That by itself isn't
enough to render it evil though.  It is more the way [[Snape|adults/Snape]] uses it I suppose,
the way he batters [[Harry]] with it, leaving Harry with migraines and
nightmares that starts me down that path. I am not sure where, but I have also
read at least one author speculate that a skilled Legilimens might not just be
able to read and interpret, but might be able to implant and influence
thoughts, emotions, maybe even manipulate memories. That, to me, would
unquestionably be a violation of the person's free will, and thus evil.

Still, I refuse to believe that someone is born evil.  Now the fallen
nature of humanity is a very very real thing.  We tend towards sin.
But we also have free will, and sufficient free will to turn towards God
and respond to grace.  Moreover the Devil can only corrupt, not create.
The idea that you can be born with a _skill_ that is inherently immoral
to use is repugnant.  One that can only be used in specific context, in
narrow ways, fine.  Theology has to deal with concupiscense and chastity
already afterall.  But if Queenie Goldstein is born instinctively
practicing Legilimency, there must be a moral context in which it is
acceptable.  A time, a place, and a method by which she can use her gift,
even if she must (or at least should) learn to reign it in some or even
most of the time.

Still, whether or not Legilimency is not itself inherently evil,
and given that [[Occlumency]] is inherently flawed, the methods of
defense against it that are presented to us by Mrs. Rowling are woefully
insufficient. There has to be something that you can do to defend your
privacy, and potentially even the integrity of your mind, without risking
damage to yourself.

    example, but I'm taking everything in the table as a given example of use.

Lastly, as I discuss when considering [[Mental Shields]] as an
alternative to [[Occlumency]], using Legilimency must in some way undermine any
defenses you may have against being yourself attacked with it.  Whatever
[[Snape|adults/Snape]] does to protect his own thoughts, when he is attacking
[[Harry]]'s mind, he feels the need to take the extra step of removing certain
thoughts to make them that much more inaccessible.[^20191119-9]
