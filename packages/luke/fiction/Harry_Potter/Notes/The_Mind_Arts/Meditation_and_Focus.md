This is probably the weekest attempt to dodge the problems of [[Occlumency]],
but is still worth considering.

This almost sounds like what little I remember about the differences between
eastern or oriental meditation and Christian meditation.  We do use meditation
as a form of prayer, and yet I have been told that meditation as taught by some
of the eastern religions and even some of the eastern martial arts can be
spiritually dangerous.  This difference between focusing on emptying yourself
versus focusing on something or someone does seem to capture what I recall the
difference being.

Naturally the version [[Sirius]] is criticising here is the version [[Snape]]
teaches, and apparently true [[Occlumency]].  What [[Sirius]] is recommending is
thus something related, but different. I suspect it would work well against
[[Legilimency]] but only if you knew it was being used against you.  That
being said, he is right that it _would_ have benifits for the boys' control over
their tempers.
