see _[Balm](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13829286)_.  Chapter 11 has some
interesting notes, as do some of the earlier chapters. 

See
_[Hope](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126154552/https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/)_ for a related take on veela. I'll have to re-find the epilogue for the fully fleshed out vision.
