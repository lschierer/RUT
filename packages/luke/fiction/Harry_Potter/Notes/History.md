* Romans pulled out of Britain around 410[^20200623-1].  While Hadrian's wall
  isn't technically the furthest north they ever went, it seems to be the
  furthest consistently controlled, and probably represents the northern bounds
  of Christianity. Note, that bit about Christianity is pure speculation on my
  part.  Interestingly, the oldest known "split-nib metal dip pen" dates from
  around then.[^20200816-1]

* While the historical reality of King Arthur is uncertain, he would necessarily
  exist in this timeline.  To the extent that King Arthur and Merlin are
  historical, they are somewhere in the 500s.[^20200713-3]  Merlin could not have
	been sorted into Slytherin, despite the Pottermore claims.[^20210111-1]

* Augustine of Canterbury arrived in 597.[^20200623-2] He focused on Kent, so it
  probably didn't impact northern Scotland till much later. 

* Northumbria, the northern most of the English precursor kingdoms, converted in
  the 600s.[^20200623-3]

* "Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth
  century"[^20200623-4] The exact progress of Christianity in Scotland seems to
  be largely speculative, messy, and slow.

* The Norse raiders imposed paganism in the areas they controlled, starting
  sometime around 800 through apparently the 10th century.[^20200623-5]

* "The long reign (900–942/3) of Donald's successor Causantín (Constantine II)
  is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba/Scotland, and
  he was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with
  the Catholic Church."[^20210406-30]

* 927 - July 12, Kingdom of England formed by Æthelstan.[^20210406-1]

* 939 - Edmund I of England.[^20210406-10]

* 943 - Malcolm I of Scotland.[^20210406-31]

* 946 - Eadred of England.[^20210406-11]

* 954 - Indulf of Scotland.[^20210406-32]

* 955 - Eadwig of England.[^20210406-12]

* 959 - Edgar the Peaceful of England.[^20210406-13]

* 962 - Dub of Scotland.[^20210406-33]

* 967 - Cuilén An Fionn of Scotland.[^20210406-34]

* 971 - Kenneth II of Scotland, is reign appears to overlap with that of
  Amlaíb?[^20210406-36]

* 973 - Amlaíb of Scotland.[^20210406-35]

* 975 - Edward the Martyr of England.[^20210406-14]

* 978 - Æthelred of England.[^20210406-15]

* Hogwarts was founded "over a thousand years" before HP2.[^20200622-1] Given
  the above, we can safely say that by pretty much any date in the 800s or 900s
  Christianity was around. However, it seems safe to say that the Hogwarts
  founders would also have been recruiting students from pagan backgrounds as
  well. While the Christian students might have been very anti-magic, the pagan
  ones would more likely have seen magic as part of their religion. Be they
  druids,[^20210603-2] or Norse, the pagan priest classes no doubt included as
  much magic as Mrs. Rowling inserts into the Egyptian priest class.  While the
  Cannon text only hints at this, there is really no other good way to explain
  what Bill is doing in Egypt. There was no Statute of Secrecy after all.

* 995 - Constantine III of Scotland.[^20210406-37]

* 1013 - Sweyn Forkbeard of England, a Danish King.[^20210406-16]

* 1014 - Æthelred of England.[^20210406-17]

* 1016 - Edmond Ironside of England.[^20210406-18]

* 1016 - Canute of England, another Dane.[^20210406-19]

* 1042 - Edward the Confessor of England (there are actually several Danish
  kings between Canute and Edward, but I need not list every single one).[^20210406-20]

* 1066 Norman invasion.[^20200704-3]  Malfoy family established in
  England[^20200810-1]

* 1066 - December 25, William I of England is the first Norman king(there were
  several kings after Edward and before William that do not matter).[^20210406-21]

* 1094 - Duncan II of Scotland, he is the first that is listed as "Rex
  Scottorum."[^20210406-38]

* 12th century (1100s) "Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and
  eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer’, became corrupted in time to
  ‘Potter’."[^20200810-2]  His eldest son marries the oldest granddaughter of
  Ignotus [[Peverell|Families/Peverell]].[^20200810-6]

* 1189 - Richard I the Lionheart of England.[^20210406-22]

* 1215 Magna Carta first signed.[^20200713-1]  Per the article on it, it is
  clear that Catholicism is either universal, or nearly so, by this point. If we
  are to use the barons' rebellions as the origins of the
  Wizengamot[^20200713-2], then wizarding culture has been fairly heavily
  influenced by Christianity by this point.  How influenced?  In other words,
  how much of the wizards' conversion is real and how much is for show?
  Reference the "Fat Friar"'s presence as a Hogwart's ghost. Even if they are
  not practising Catholics, how much of the pagan culture have they actually
  lost? This is not a purely academic question; its answer will determine how
  much of the magic that multi-generational wizarding families practice is just
  wands, potions, and engraved runes and how much is ritual song, dance, chants,
  sacrifices, meals, and other elements of paganism.  It will also determine
  how, for lack of a better word, Victorian wizarding society can possibly
  become. 

* 1216 - Henry III of England, his rule was briefly disputed by the French
  king.[^20210406-24]

* 1217 - Louis VIII of France becomes Louis I of England very briefly. He signs
  a treaty acknowledging that "he had never been the legitimate king of
  England."[^20210406-23]

* 1258 - Parliament, initially a council of 15 barons, assembled under Henry III
  due to the "Provisions of Oxford" and the "Provisions of Westminster," unsure
  which (or both).[^20210406-3]

* 1272 - Edward I (Longshanks) of England.[^20210406-25] I am unsure why he is
  Edward the first when there are earlier Edwards.

* 1284 - England conquers Wales.[^20210406-2]

* 1286 - The Guardians of Scotland are regents who governed
  Scotland.[^20210406-39]  There seems to be more than one at any given time.

  time.[^20210406-46]

  Ireland.[^20210406-7]

* 1612-1652 Ralston Potter seated in the Wizengamot.  Statute of Secrecy being debated.[^20210122-24] 

* 1618-1648 Witch hunting across Europe reaches its apex during the 30 years
  war.[^20200704-4]  If you assume that [MACUSA] did not actually form as Mrs.
  Rowling has posited, then you can take her comments on the Potter
  family[^20210614-2] and make some really interesting speculations about what
  was happening in Europe. 

* 1644-1647 Witch hunting in England peaks during the English Civil
  War.[^20200704-5]

* 1649 - Start of the English "Interregnum" and the Commonwealth of
  England.[^20210406-28]

* 1660 - End of the English "Interregnum," Charles II of England.[^20210406-29]

* 1688 - "The kingdom of England, as well as its successor states the Kingdom of
  Great Britain and the United Kingdom, have functioned in effect as a
  constitutional monarchy."[^20210406-8]

* 1689 - the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689.[^20200623-6]  In _[The
  Accidental Animagus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/89/The-Accidental-Animagus)_ fanfiction author White Squirrel speculates that not only did society take an abrupt shift, with the pure-blood mania becoming more prominent than it had ever been, but that the magical society probably started to rewrite its own history, erasing evidence of its dealings with non-magical society, and of its own mutations and shifts over time.  In England, the Potters argue for the Statute to protect the Muggles,[^20200810-3] the Malfoys argue against it (to continue exploiting the wealthy among whom Malfoys often marry).[^20200810-4]  Once it passes, the Malfoys pretend to have been in favour all along.[^20200810-5]

* 1692 What would eventually be Coutts Bank is started by John Campbell at the
  sign of The Three Crowns in Strand, London.[^20200818-1]  At least one
  fanfiction uses this as a partly goblin owned bank to get around the Statute
  of Secrecy.[^20200818-2]

* "Tiny old man" with a "squeaky voice that made passersby stare" - probably
  Flitwick.
* Dumbledore arrives at "nearly midnight." Where has Harry been all day? 
* Hagrid says he flew over Bristol. There is very very little of the West
  Country in which Godric's Hollow could be located for Bristol to be between it
  and Surrey.  Instead, Bristol seems to indicate a detour to the north, or a
  point of origin in Wales.

[^20210603-2]: I know the popular theory is to white-wash the druids, but I
    refuse to do so.  Mr. James Owen's "[Druids Committed Human Sacrifice,
    Cannibalism?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/druids-sacrifice-cannibalism)"
    [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) 2009-03-20. This
    article may provide only one example, but to me there is no real reason to
    dismiss Caesar and Pliny the Elder's testimony to begin with, so having a
    confirming piece of evidence like this really just makes the whole thing
    rather irrefutable.
