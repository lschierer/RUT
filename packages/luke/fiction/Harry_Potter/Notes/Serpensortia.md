The transcription of the [Book of Spells][] references a "Principle of
Artificianimate Quasi-Dominance" and goes on to state that for poorly understood
and entirely unstated reasons, birds and snakes are easier to conjur than
anything else.[^20210930-21]  I do not feel this rather hand-wavy
quasi-explanation truly addresses Mr. Hycrest's objections above.
