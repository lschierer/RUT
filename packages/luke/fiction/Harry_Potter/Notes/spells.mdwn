### a
#### Accio[^20210930-33]

#### Aguamenti
Conjures clean drinkable water from the end of the wand.[^20210930-6] Appears to
be a violation of Gramp's Law? 
#### Alohomora[^20210930-11]
Introduced in the early 1600s from Africa by Eldon Elsrickle. 
#### Anti-Alohomora[^20210930-13]
Developed by Blagdon Blay.
#### Aparecium[^20210930-23]
Shows ink and messages hidden by magical means, overcoming most basic
concealment charms.  
#### Avis[^20210930-20]
The small flock created are not actually real animals.
### b
#### Bat-Bogey Hex[^20210930-29]

away. 
#### Bird-Conjuring Charm
See Avis.
### c
#### Confundus Charm[^20210930-1]

### d

### e
#### Engorgio[^20210930-24]
Make things grow or swell. 
#### Expecto Patronum[^20210930-40]
An ancient charm that conjures a magical guardian.  The guardian, if fully
corporeal, generally takes the form of the animal with whom the caster shares
the deepest affinity.  The guardian is a projection of all your most positive
feelings, and will repel a Dementor.  Size of the animal is not reflective of
the power of the guardian, but rather brightness.  The description claims that
someone sufficiently impure casting this spell will cause maggots to gush from
the casting wand which will consume the castor.  
#### Expelliarmus[^20210930-36]
Cause a whatever a person is holding, most importantly their wand, to fly out of

### g
#### Gemino[^20210930-26]

will degrade faster than the original.  The doubling process can be halted only
by the caster. The description implies that the number of copies can be either
controlled or uncontrolled.
