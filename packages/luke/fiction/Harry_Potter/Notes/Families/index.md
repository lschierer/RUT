## Information about families that do not require a page to themselves.

[[!toc levels=2 startlevel=3]]

I generated a graph showing many of the characters and how they relate to each
other, "centred" on [[Ginny]].  This was generated using Gramps, and while
graphviz made a few odd placement choices, it is still fairly useful.
Unfortunately, it puts people unrelated to [[Ginny]] in a row across the top,
even in the few cases where those people do have dates associated with them
(this is why I "centred" it on her, she is more closely related to more people
than [[Harry]]).

### Abbott family

One of the curious things is how few works pair [[Harry]] with Hannah Abbott.
The Abbott family is listed as one of the so-called "Sacred
Twenty-Eight",[^211004-10] and yet Mrs. Rowling seems to have had a fair
amount of trouble settling on Hannah's [[blood
status|Class_and_Blood]].[^211004-11]  Hannah appears in the books only a
few times, the first is a very ineffectual defence of [[Harry]] where she
initially states he cannot be the heir of [[Slytherin|Hogwarts/Founding]], but
backs down in the face of Ernie Macmillan's assured intransigence.[^211004-12]
The next, we see her wearing a "Support Cedric" badge, but it does not say
anything about her interacting with [[Harry]] directly.[^211004-13]  We then
hear that she is pulled from school because her mother is killed in an attack by
either [[Riddle|adults/Riddle]] or his Death Eaters.[^211004-14]  Lastly, we
know she fought in the last battle.[^211004-15]

### Belby family

Damocles Belby was taught by Slughorn and invented the Wolfsbane Potion, for
which he received an Order of Merlin.[^210318-1]

### Black family

Unlike the Longbottom family, we have at least one cannon reference for the
blacks as a "noble" family.  We do not know if that means they were in fact
part of the peerage or not though.  A significant part of a ton of fanfiction
out there assumes there is a "family vault" that is controlled by a "Lord
Black." It also seems to be a reasonable supposition based on what the books do
state.  Many such fanfiction works further speculate that the [[Malfoy]] family
expects to inherit that control and that title.  If you take Mrs. Rowling's
Black family tree[^210122-26] as part of cannon, such speculation is
baseless.  You have to be careful because she does not clearly distinguish
the male and female children, and because she does not put the children in
birth order on any given line, but if you work your way through it, once
Phineas Nigellus inherited, then the his son Sirius II was heir.
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion, [[Harry]]'s Godfather, descends from that line.
Assume that a godson cannot inherit - reasonable.  Next in line would be
Arcturus I, who had no male children, but decedents of Harfang Longbottom are
unlisted, that might include Neville.  Secondly, since we know that
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion was not properly disinherited because he *does*
inherit Grimmauld Place, it is reasonable to suspect that Cedrella Black might
not have been either, despite her marriage to Septimus Weasley.  If so, then the
[[Weasleys|Weasley]] would be in line after the Longbottoms (assuming it is a
different and now extinct branch of the Longbottom family that descends from
Harfang).  We *know* that [[Arthur|adults/Arthur]] [[Weasley]], minimally, lives
to inherit, so there would be no need to go to the third son of Phineus Nigellus - 
Cygnus I, from whom Draco is descended.  Remember, even if girls cannot
inherit, their sons can.   If the Black family is following an absolute male
only primogeniture, then Draco would still be unable to inherit as he is in line
via his mother, who would be disqualified by gender.  The dates for this line of
speculation are in the [[History]] timeline. 

On a side note, while it flies in the face of some of what I've written above,
Tigerman has an interesting theory in his work [RuneMaster][RMff1].  He suggests
that it is very odd that the portrait of Walburga Black should be so hard to
curtain and cover the way it is, and that more magic must be at work than just
the sticking charm.[^210527-1] While is sense of story timeline is bizarre, I
do like this theory.

### Bones Family 

Susan Bones' grandparents are the ones killed by Riddle.[^210301-1] She lost
an uncle, aunt, and cousins to one of the ten death eaters freed during _Order
of the Phoenix_.[^210519-10]  She is [[listed|ClassLists]] as being a
halfblood, despite coming from a family with enough influence that her Aunt is
head of the [[DMLE|Culture]].[^210701-1] How close is Susan's relationship with
her Aunt?  Is [[Amelia|adults/Amelia]] a traditionalist even if she also believes in
justice?[^210701-2]  Or is Amelia fairly broad minded?[^210701-3]

[^210701-3]: This view of Amelia is shown in Fibinaci's _[Padfoot, Docteur
    D'amour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4510080)_. 

[^210701-2]: This idea puts Susan at odds with her aunt in VonPelt's _[Her
    Finest Hour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13654352/1/Her-Finest-Hour)_. 

[^210701-1]: I do not think you can advance *that high* in the Ministry without
    influence.  That might be political influence, familial influence, or the
    kind you get from knowing everyone's dirty laundry.

### Greengrass family

Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^200520-1].  This
is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly debated.  A
word search on the American Kindle edition shows her name only in relation to
the Charms OWL practicals.  Interestingly Pansy, Millicent and a Sixth Year girl
are members of the Inquisitorial Squad, but Daphne is not.  Why did Umbridge not
trust her?

Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what we do know
about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as part
of cannon, something I tend not to do.  Mrs. Rowling says Astoria went "through
a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood
ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^200701-1] The interesting thing about
this paragraph is that it is nearly all innuendo and comparison with few direct
statements. It says *Daphne* is a Slytherin, but nothing of Astoria's sorting.
It says Astoria believed pure-blood ideals, but while Draco's upbringing talks
specifically about being a Death Eater upbringing, there is a curious lack of
specificity about Astoria. I find it curious that Narcissa and Lucius "had high
hopes" based on her family's status on the Sacred Twenty-Eight.  If her father
had been a Death Eater along with Lucius, surely they would have more than
merely that to base their hopes on?

Both girls appear to have an uncle, Gareth Greengrass, which I am inferring from
the fact that the wiki lists him as having only one daughter, which is neither
known girl, and his wife as having a brother-in-law.  The uncle was apparently
not a death eater, but if you accept _Harry Potter: Wizards Unite_ as
canonical, he did get himself in trouble violating the Statute of Secrecy.

### Longbottom Family

Lots of fanfiction puts the Longbottom family into the nobility.  I see no
indication of Augusta Longbottom being called "Lady Longbottom" outside of
fanfiction.  We have few descriptions of her, but her fox fur is described as
"moth eaten," which means that if they are part of the nobility, they are
impoverished.

### McLaggen Family

The McLaggen family is apparently well connected, sufficiently so to impress
Slughorn.[^210318-2] Given Scrimgeour's behaviour across book six and the bit
of book seven he is alive for, my guess is that Scrimgeour is not a sympathiser
of the death eaters, but *is* strongly of the "might makes right" approach to
magic.  This is pure speculation, but my guess is that the two families are
probably both old money, and strongly invested in preserving the status quo.
They do not mind first generation magical users per-se, so long as they stay in
their place — at or near the bottom of the social order.

### Zabini

We really only know of Blaize Zabini.  We know his mother has been married seven
times, and that each of the seven husbands has died leaving her
money.[^210318-3] We do not know which marriage produced Blaize, thus we do not
know if his mother has retained the same last name or not.
