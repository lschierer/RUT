[[meta title="Basilisk"]]

A basilisk is one of those things that is so incredibly scary that people (in
universe) may not have fully thought it through.  While a basilisk may be an
apex predator, when emplaced/employed by a witch or wizard, it is only really
useful as part of an ambush. The fact that Riddle kills all the roosters in
_Chamber of Secrets_[^211007-4] tends to confirm non-magical legends that the
sound of a crow's cry is fatal to it.[^211007-3]  If you take that as true, then
anyone who 1) knows there is a basilisk around and 2) has any time to prepare
can defeat the snake fairly trivially. This remains true even if a transfigured
rooster is not sufficiently real to cause the desired effect.
