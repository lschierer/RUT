### On Adults in General

One of the challenges I have noticed across children's and young adult's
literature is how to deal with adults.  If you have a set of adults who are both
competent and *good*, why would a child be the protagonist?  Any adult in his or
her right mind sympathises with [[Molly]] in wanting to protect the children
from all that is harsh in the world.  We may not carry it to the extremes that
she does, but we understand her motivations.  Thus when [[Dumbledore]] says that
he wants to preserve [[Harry]]'s childhood,[^210521-7] we *want* to believe
him.  For the alternative is to face the possibility that the man who leads the
fight against evil is complicit in it.  

To create a situation in which a bunch of teens must repeatedly save the world,
Mrs. Rowling compromises all of her adult characters.  Some of them are
compromised by situation, but the majority have fatal flaws.  It is a testament
to her ability that so many of these characters never the less come across as
*good people* struggling in *really bad situations.*  In these [[Notes]], I
intend to pull no punches.  I will expose these flaws for what they are.  I am
going to try to show which characters are good people who do bad things, and
which are bad people who do good things. If, however, any of the adults in Harry's
life were really unreservedly praiseworthy, he or she, and not Harry, would be
the main character from that point forward. 

I have read a few fan fictions that try to find a middle ground.  Essentially it
consists of an evil, or at minimum a deeply misguided [[Dumbledore]].  One who
differs from Riddle only in that neither can handle the other being in control,
and in some of the *details* but not the general shape of their vision of the
world.  With two powerful forces acting against Harry, the competent adult is
overwhelmed, and unable to fully shield him.  I cannot say that is is entirely
unbelievable.  [[Dumbledore]] does, or more often fails to do, a great many
things that make him an incredibly ambiguous figure.  It is not a great leap to
paint him as the Dark Lord of the prophecy, who has marked Harry, not
physically, but metaphorically, as the one who could be his equal.[^210521-8]

[^210521-8]: This idea is not originally mine, but I do not remember which
    fanfictions I have read it in.  If I come across them again, I will note
    them here. 

[^210521-7]: Mrs. J. K. Rowling. _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_
    Citation needed.  It is the scene after the Department of Mysteries, in his
    office.
