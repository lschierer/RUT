[[meta title="Does Dumbledore Ever Accomplish Anything?"]]

A recurring theme in fanfiction is Dumbledore's inaction.  Not only is this a
theme in fanfiction, I question it time and time again as Dumbledore [[interacts
with Riddle|Dealing_with_Riddle]], with [[Harry]] and the [[Dursleys]], and even
with [[Grindelwald]].  Dumbledore has three jobs, each of which is the sort of
prestigious position that influences a signature line of a letter, in some cases
even when *someone else* is signing the letter in question.[^211015-1]  What
does he do with these positions to shape society?  How does he use them to
advance reform, battle injustice, or steer the wayward towards the light? Is the
sum total of his accomplishments in his tenure as Headmaster at Hogwarts that he
allowed one werewolf to be educated?  Were there no other were-children in the
many years he was there? 

Some fanfiction works that have built on this team:

* on the idea that Hogwarts should offer languages because while pure-bloods
  might learn a second language at home, not every student at the school has
  that opportunity. 
* secondly on the idea that Bill Weasley can be trusted to investigate the curse
  on the defence position, since [[Dumbledore]] has *already* trusted him to
  help with the wards on [[Harry]]'s house (in this story).
