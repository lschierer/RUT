[[!meta title="Dumbledore's Treatment of Harry"]]
In explaining his decisions to Harry, Dumbledore says:

> Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had
> planned and intended. Well not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you
> would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was
> condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.[20210912-2

> You arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished
> as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not
> a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped
> under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.[^20210912-3]

He justifies this saying: 

> My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger
> than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours
> before, but his supporters and many of them are almost as terrible as he
> were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my
> decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort
> was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty
> years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too,
> knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed
> you.[^20210912-4]
 
There are two problems with this, and they are connected. 

First is the prophecy.  From her website FAQ,

> The prophecy Harry hears in Dumbledore’s office suggests to me that both he
> and Voldemort will have to die, is that true?
> 
> Both Madam Trelawney and I worded the prophecy extremely carefully and that
> is all I have to say on the subject![^20210912-5]

I am speculating here, but everything I've read and heard about Mrs. Rowling suggests that for all the flaws that I and others have pointed out, she tried *really really* hard in planning the novels out.  I think her comment about wording the prophecy very carefully applies to more than just Harry's encounter with Riddle at the end.  She says that in her opinion this prophecy is like that in [Macbeth][WSM1], it is a catalyst a series of events, but that the characters retain free will.[^20210912-6]  I think that Harry's suffering, not just his death experience in the forest in book seven, are one of the things it triggered.  For all the prophesy does not name Dumbledore, it shapes his actions much as the one that Macbeth hears shapes his actions. 

In the fan fiction work _[The Sound of Silence][BW95TSS1]_ Dumbledore states:

> I couldn't stand what I did to that poor, poor child. But I knew it was
> necessary. Our society needed time to heal, to recover from the first blood
> war. Voldemort will come back if Harry lives, but no one can kill Harry
> except Voldemort. The Dursleys certainly did their level best to kill him.
> They couldn't.
> 
> The stronger Harry is, the stronger Voldemort is. He will return. It is only through the actions that I have already taken that he hasn't already returned. As you judge me, remember the war. Remember what it was like.[^20210912-7]

Mrs. Rowling does not allow her version of Dumbledore to admit any such thing, but I think there is some element of truth to this take on his character.  If, however, I am off base, it makes the next point even stronger. 

In the fan fiction work _[After Destiny][CAD1]_, cambangst presents a view of [[Harry]], [[Ginny]], and the other student fighters that is overly influenced by modern secular morality, but shows them struggling with the traumas they have faced in a way that I *do* find very realistic.  The following is part of an exchange between [[Harry]] and [[Ginny]].  

> "Training, Harry." She really wanted to smack him again, but settled for
> doing her best Hermione, instead. "Do you know how long Charlie had to train
> before they would even let him near a dragon?" He shook his head. "Four
> months. Four months, five days a week, eight hours a day. And that was after
> getting the highest N.E.W.T. score in Care of Magical Creatures since
> Grindelwald's War." Ginny leaned closer, until they were almost nose to
> nose. "Remind me, Harry, how much training did you get for this job?"
> 
> Harry blinked a few times and then looked down. "A few evenings with
> Dumbledore."[^20210912-1]

As I stated on the main [[Dumbledore]] page, I believe that Dumbledore, at
heart, embraces some  version of [[utilitarianism|Society/utilitarianism]].
Rightly or wrongly, he believed that the [[horcrux|Horcruxes]] in [[Harry]]
required that [[Harry]] be destroyed, or in other words, he would have to
die.[^20210912-9]  Under utilitarian theory, while [[Harry]]'s death might be
tragic, it is outweighed by the salvation it would bring to the rest of
society when [[Riddle]] is vanquished.  Thus [[Harry]] must be programmed
towards self-sacrifice.

Again, Mrs. Rowling never allows her version of Dumbledore to admit that he has intentionally worked towards this end.  Her version of Dumbledore claims that the whole thing was, from beginning to end, entirely [[Harry]]'s free choice, and in a sense that is true.  It is true in the sense that no one held a gun to his head and forced his action.  Dumbledore was much more subtle than that.  He allowed [[Harry]] to spend ten years in an [[abusive environment|Dursleys]].  He allowed [[Snape]] to belittle and torment [[Harry]].  He did nothing as the school as a whole turned on [[Harry]] in first year,[^20210912-10] second year,[^20210912-11] fourth year,[^20210912-12] *and* fifth year.[^20210912-13]  

Even the lack of training fits into this.  Dumbledore tells [[Harry]] that love is the "power" leaving [[Harry]] confused at first, but knowing that when the final bits of the puzzle are revealed, it will all make sense - an untrained [[Harry]] has no other weapon in his arsenal except the power of his self-sacrifice with which to protect his friends.  He even tells [[Harry]] that he depended on [[Hermione]] to *slow [[Harry]] down*[^20210913-1] and while they were specifically talking about the Hallows, when you consider that [[Hermione]] also slowed down the hunt for the [[horcruxes]] (see her page for details), I feel safe including this in my indictment. 

When you consider the potential cost if Riddle had not been stopped, and
further consider the fact *that it worked*, it is very hard to argue with
Dumbledore.  The fact that [[Harry]] not only does not blame him, but feels
great affection for him makes it even harder.  There is just one problem.
[[Utilitarianism is wrong|Society/utilitarianism]].

    I have chosen to quote Mrs. Rowling to substantiate this rather than something she's had Dumbledore say because I feel this puts it even more beyond doubt than anything else I could do.  I am essentially saying that Dumbledore's deductions, intuitions, whatever you chose to attribute it to, would end up agreeing with the author's own opinion on the subject.
