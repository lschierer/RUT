James Potter is one of the more controversial figures in the Harry Potter
series.  There is so little information about him, that both fanfiction authors
and just opinion pieces and commentators are working with an almost blank slate. 

### From the books

> Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood,[^20210128-17]

---

> Harry recognised his father; his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses.[^20210128-22]

James' family is well off, his father is described as having quadrupled the
family gold,[^20210511-1] and the way it is written implies that this is
*before* he sold the company.  Given the description of wizarding medicine, why
does he need glasses? 

---

> James Potter

> Born 27 March 1960

> Died 31 October 1981[^20210128-23]

---

> “Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James asked
> the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized
> that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. 
> 
> “My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. 
> 
> “Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!” 
> 
> Sirius grinned. “Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?” 
> 
> James lifted an invisible sword. “‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.”[^20210128-24]

…

> “Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius.
> 
> James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James
> to Sirius in dislike. 
> 
> “Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”
> 
> “Oooooo . . .”

> James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip

> 
> “See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door
> slammed. . . .[^20210920-1]

James, like [[Ron]], grew up thinking ill of Slytherin.  I sometimes wonder if that
is really the root of most of the controversy between Lily and James.  We cannot
know from cannon, but imagine a Lily who is very loyal, perhaps slightly
irrationally so, to her friends, and one who holds grudges.  The combination is
not unbelievable.  James has just insulted her best friend, and will go on to
pick on him unmercifully.  Perhaps Lily cannot really see James with an unbiased
eye until after she herself has fallen out with [[Snape]]?  

---

> Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air,[^20210128-14]

[[Snape]] attacks to draw blood; a cutting curse to the neck could kill, to the
eyes could blind.  We do not *know* that this is a dark curse that cannot be
easily healed, but we know that such exist. Even a standard cutting spell could
have killed before anyone could do anything if it hit the carotid artery or
jugular vein.  James retaliates with humiliation; cruel yes, on the same scale
as risk of death? Perhaps [[Snape]] would say no, but most courts would say that
[[Snape]]'s crime is worse.

---

> "Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?” 

> “Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.” 

> “What?” 

> “He saved his life.”[^20210128-5]

---

> your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine.[^20210128-8]

We have nothing but [[Snape]]'s (untrustworthy) word to stay that James knew of
[[Sirius]]' plans for [[Snape]] in advance.  According to Lupin, it was
[[Sirius]] alone who told Snape about the tree,[^20210511-2] it is typical of
[[Snape]] that he blames James for [[Sirius]]' actions. 

---

> but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back,[^20210128-20]

---

> “He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ..."[^20210128-6]

---

> “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”[^20210128-4]

---

> “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen —”[^20210128-7] 

---

> “I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle.”[^20210128-21]

---

> “No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.” 
> 
> “I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin.[^20210128-9]

---

> “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course exceptionally bright, in fact but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers”[^20210128-19]

It is interesting that so many people assume that James was a total idiot.  I do
not think that a realistic take on his character - I do not think anyone would
say that [[McGonagall]] is given to false or light praise.  We know he was good
at transfiguration, but I think most people dismiss that because his only known
accomplishment is the animagus transformation, and Pettigrew also accomplished
that.  My take is that it is actually a testament to James' skills that he was
able to coach the unskilled Pettigrew through the process.  I also wonder what
other classes he took, and which ones he did how well at.  Did he take Ancient
Runes or Arithmancy?  Who was top of the year at Defence?  James' father was
famous for potion making, perhaps James did not inherit all of his father's
skills, but it seems unlikely that he did *poorly* at the subject - his father
would have tutored him over the summers should he have needed it. 

---

> Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it.[^20210128-3] 

Normally authors state that *Lily* was the cleverest in the school.  At some
point I need to do a similar quote search for her, but this flies in the face of
that. 

---

> “I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.” 
> 
> “You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me ... Here.” He held out his book. 
> 
> Sirius snorted. “I don’t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.” 
>
> “This’ll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it is ...”[^20210128-12] 

I would have to find the citation, but I know I am not alone in wondering if
this memory was tampered with.  The fact that [[Lupin]] and [[Sirius]] would not
deny anything in the brief fireplace conversation suggests that it is at best
based on something factual, but then so too are the best lies.  It would be a
more cunning and effective plan to subtlety twist the memory to put James in a
worse light, portray [[Snape]] as a more innocent victim, but leave the core
events sufficiently in place so that when [[Harry]] describes what he sees, it
rings true to those who witnessed it.  

---

> “You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.”[^20210128-10]

[[Sirius]] implies that James was a daredevil.  Is that a true depiction, or a
distortion due to his time in Azkaban?  Some of both is the most likely.  Even
if true, I strongly suspect that the man who went into hiding to save his son
would not have wanted his son to be as much a daredevil as he himself might have
been in his youth.  

---

> Harry wondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge.[^20210128-11]

[[Harry]] has not noticed at this point that his mother is one of those girls.
Is James enjoying the attention because he wants *anyone's* attention, or is he
enjoying it as a (probably mistaken) indication that what he is doing might
attract *Lily's*?  Perception is everything, and *[[Snape]]'s* memory does not
really tell us what is going on in *James'* head. 

---

> “All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature. 

> “Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. “What’s he done to you?” 

> “Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “it’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean ...” 

> Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and neither did Lily. 

> “You think you’re funny,” she said coldly. “But you’re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.”[^20210128-13]

See my comments above on possible subtle manipulations of the memory. Still, it
is pretty much established that [[Lily]] and James did not get along until either
the end of sixth year or, more likely, the beginning of seventh. 

---

> Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, “Let him down!”[^20210128-15]

She did not like James' behaviour, but she was not fully immune to the humour in
the situation either.  At least some of her behaviour is a false front, probably
because she feels she should behave that way, or because she feels she *needs*
to behave that way to get the results she wants. 

---

> “Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each other from
> the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you
> can understand that, can’t you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to
> be he was popular, he was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything.
> And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts
> and James — whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry always hated the
> Dark Arts.” 
> 
> “Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just
> because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he finished with a
> slightly apologetic note in his voice. 
> 
> “I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly. 
> 
> Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what you’ve got
> to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at
> whatever they did — everyone thought they were the height of cool — if they
> sometimes got a bit carried away —” 
> 
> “If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.[^20210128-16]

The book does not tell us exactly how detailed a description [[Harry]] gave the two
of what he say.  I really wish it gave us more, it would answer the question on
how accurate the memory was.  The thing is that even [[Sirius]] here can admit that
at least some of what they did was wrong.  We cannot be sure how much, but
admitting that you were an "arrogant little berk" means that [[Sirius]] has matured
at least some from what he was.  If [[Sirius]] can admit that despite his obvious
desire to live in the past, then the change, the maturation, in James must have
been still more profound.

### From Pottermore:

> WAND: Eleven inches, mahogany[^20210128-25]

eleven inches is about average for a wand, it does not tell us much about James.
The wood, mahogany, is not one listed on Pottermore's page about wand
woods.[^20210511-3]

---

> PARENTS: Fleamont and Euphemia Potter[^20210128-26]

---

> into the world before baby James came along. They were much older, and
> wealthy, so James grew up in a doting environment without the compromise of
> siblings, in a home without material limits.[^20210128-27]

---

> went on to become Head Boy[^20210128-28]

---

> Fleamont and Euphemia lived long enough to see James marry a Muggle-born girl
> called Lily Evans, but not to meet their grandson, Harry. Dragon pox carried
> them off within days of each other, due to their advanced age, and James
> Potter then inherited Ignotus [[Peverell|Families/Peverell]]’s Invisibility Cloak.[^20210128-29]

### When did he get the Cloak

In book three, [[Lupin]] refers to seeing James use the cloak many
times.[^20210318-4] At first I was inclined to disregard this, the fact that
[[Lupin]] knows that you still show up on the Marauder's Map implies that it was at
school, but does not prove that.  For all we know the two got curious when James
inherited the cloak *after graduation* and tested the cloak against the charms
they had used.  After all, while they had lost the map, as the creators, they
could have recreated enough of its detection mechanisms to prove the test case,
or alternately there may have been multiple copies of the map originally, only
one of which was seized.[^20210318-5] However, further down, he definitively
places the cloak in James' possession by at least their fifth year, as it was
used to get out of the castle each full moon.[^20210318-6]

Given that he would not officially inherit the Cloak until his father dies, why
was such a valuable heirloom sent with an irresponsible child to school?  This
is pure speculation, but one possibility is that James was *not* as irresponsible
as he is made out to be.  By 1975 the Riddle's violence was no doubt ramping up,
if not already in full swing.  We know, reference my discussion of James above,
and my discussion of [[Snape]], that some of the Slytherin students are
experimenting with [[dark magic|Magic]].  Perhaps Fleamont sent his son to
school with the cloak as an additional layer of protection for a beloved, and
yes, somewhat spoiled heir, knowing the boy (James) was feuding with such evil
already.  Despite his many illicit forays out after curfew, this supposedly
irresponsible boy kept the Cloak out of larcenous[^20210318-7] enemy hands,
despite the fact that he supposedly has no cunning or intelligence. 

### Pure Speculation

Consider some of the stuff [[Harry]] goes through in Books 1 and 2.  Given that,
Ian Hycrest speculates that with [[Dumbledore]] and [[McGonagall]] even more
distracted by the more active war that was then going on, and with [[Slughorn]]
trying to avoid [[Riddle]]'s notice,[^20210629-2] there were probably students
openly planning on becoming Death Eaters, and openly preparing for their
proposed careers, probably with no real repercussions.[^20210629-3] In such an
environment, James Potter, who hated the dark arts,[^20210629-4] may have had
reasons for his pranks that [[Snape]] and [[Lily]] were unwilling to
acknowledge.  He may, per Mr. Hycrest's theory, have been guilty of poor
targeting and have occasionally over-reacted, but he was *reacting* not
*instigating*.
