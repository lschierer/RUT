<p>For all I do not think I would choose it for myself, I certainly do like much that Apple has done with MacOSX.  I just booted off a DVD, having told it to do so without the use of a monitor or keyboard (using just the two buttons on the front and the led lights), ssh-ed in, set up a raid array, and am now installing the system, from that ssh shell.  That is Very Cool&#x2122;.</p>
