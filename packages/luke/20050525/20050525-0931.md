<p>Okay, yes, I am vain, but this week's Debian Weekly News email
just made my day.</p>

<blockquote>Debian-Volatile Strategy. The volatile team
[29]pondered to create a second [30]volatile archive with less
strict criteria. This would help packages such as [31]Gaim that
need to be updated during the lifetime of sarge in order to support
modified protocols. They are also looking for ways to announce
updated packages. <br  />

31. http://packages.debian.org/gaim </blockquote>

<p>I talked to some of the #Debian-release guys about this late
last week, when I learned that we would not be able to back port
some rather trivial bug fixes to Debian's 1.2.1 Gaim package with
any significant chance of getting them accepted.  If we cannot get
trivial bug fixes in, how in the world would we ever get the kind
of significant changes that a new authentication for a protocol
would cause?  I would rather avoid a situation like the current
Debian stable, which has a 0.58 that will not work with many of
the protocols it claims to support.</p>

<p>It is nice to be listened to.</p>
