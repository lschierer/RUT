<p> <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/04-27-2005/2d820007bc101f2d.html">This
development</a> in California is rather disturbing.  Any bill to
legalize homosexual "marriage" is disturbing of course, but this
one is beyond that.  This one really does show the extent that
these activists will go to force us to accept their immorality.
According to the article, the California state constitution does
not allow the legislature to modify statues that were passed by
referendum.  In 2000, just the sort of definition of a marriage
as being between a man and a woman that other states have made
constitutional amendments was passed by sixty-one percent of
the California electorate.  So this new bill allowing homosexual
"marriages" is rather blatantly unconstitutional.</p>
