Okay, so I've now imported all the old log entries into Word Press.  It is FAR from pretty, and all the links across posts are broken, but the content is there and I still have the original files if I ever want them.   Many thanks to Vincas for the import script.  Oh, and the limitations of the import are my fault, not his, because he did exactly the part I asked him to do. 

I'll be working on getting this log to *look* right later.   For now it is bed time.
