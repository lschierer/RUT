Ars is talking about a flash hard drive from Samsung.[^1] At 16Gb
max, it is, by today's standards, too small for most desktop use.
We are all spoiled by the massive 40Gb, 80Gb, and bigger hard drives
available now, and most people would have trouble getting accustomed
to having "only" 16Gb of space now.  After all, my old desktop from
college even had something like 13Gb.  Still, with 16Gb available
now (or rather, in August or so), it is only a matter of time
before these drives start reaching the sizes we are accustomed to.
In many modern systems, the disk i/o is a significant choke point, so
a 150 percent performance increase here will certainly be noticeable,
and few people (who don't download lots of movies) will notice if
the high end of these drives starts to compete (size wise) with
the low end current drive, so long as the price wise is competitive
with other drives (not necessarily of the same size).
