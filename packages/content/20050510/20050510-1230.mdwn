<p>Mrs. Michelle Malkin has posted[1] a remarkable example of
the harm that political correctness can do to society.  Political
correctness is an interesting way to silence dissent and mandate
censorship, as no one likes to be called racist, sexist, so on.
People will flee these emotionally charged labels so fast that they
will often give in rather than attempt to debate the accuracy of
the label.  Indeed, in today's atmosphere, an attempt to debate it
rather than fleeing tends to exacerbate the harm done in the minds of
the listeners, who are unlikely to engage the issue rationally.</p>
