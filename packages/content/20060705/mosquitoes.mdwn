Air Pollution in Athens Greece has been blamed for a noteworthy development in mosquitoes.<sup><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060704/hl_afp/greecehealthdisease" title="Air pollution, cramped living in Athens breeding 'super mosquitoes'">[1]</a></sup>  Apparently, the mosquitoes there are growing larger, with better vision and better smell.  They are also growing faster.  The end result is that they can detect you at 25-30 meters instead of only 15-20.  And the faster speed makes it more likely they will reach you.  This makes me want to go to Athens oh so much, how about you?
