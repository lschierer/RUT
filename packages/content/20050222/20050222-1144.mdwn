In looking at the Freedom of Religion:<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42905">Judge
drops all charges against Philly Christians</a>" restores some
semblance of sanity, this judge saw through the legal antics of
those who would silence Christians.  It is a rare piece of good
news.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38074">Impeach
Judge Napoleon Jones!</a>" is on a nearly opposite note.  This
activist judge is on a crusade to remove the Boy Scouts from the
public life over which he presides.  The ACLU is eager to help
him, with their well demonstrated hatred of all things Christian.
Apparently <em><strong>city</strong></em> governments cannot
form partnerships with the Boy Scouts to fund and maintain public
parks.<br  /><br  />

"<a href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37109">City
appeals Commandments removal</a>" is not primarily about that
judge in Mississippi, as you might expect.  Rather, it appears a
similar thing is happening in Wisconsin.  The local government there
took what seems to me an unusual step in avoiding the necessity
of removing the monument: it sold the monument and the land to a
non-profit.  Apparently even though this has worked in other cases,
it is again being challenged.  Good luck to those fighting to keep
awareness of our Christian heritage alive.<br  /><br  />

This is part of a disturbing trend that <a href="http://www.davidlimbaugh.com/">David Limbaugh</a> has spent
considerable time documenting.  There are consistent efforts
to broaden the "Wall of Separation" that Jefferson wrote of.
Somewhere recently I read about when this became precedent in the US
Supreme Court, I am going to have to find that article again.  Ah,
this is a reminder of why I set this log up, the article in question
is in my log, on <a href="./view.php?date=20050218-1203">Friday,
18th of February 2005</a>.  And surprise surprise, the ACLU was
involved in removing religion from the public sphere here also!  <a href="http://www.catholicherald.com/articles/05articles/separation.htm">this
article</a> is a must read, I find myself wanting to quote nearly
all of it.
