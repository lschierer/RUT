<p>The federal courts are starting to weigh in on the homosexual
"marriage" debate, with unfortunately predictable results.  A federal
judge in Nebraska has struck down that state's Constitutional
Amendment to ban such false marriages, claiming it goes too far and
is too broad in its restrictions on what the state of Nebraska may
recognize.[1][2] This sort of action highlights the need to Amend
the Federal Constitution.  Ideally this would not be necessary,
but we have come to accept that the federal government can preempt
the state laws and constitutions wherever it so desires.  Once it
was a given that a state could set up a state religion, that the
Federal Constitutional ban on that did not preclude state action.
In fact, I am fairly sure that such things happened in New England.
Now, we find ourselves protected from that, yet, by virtue of that
"protection," at risk of seeing religion and morality baned from the
public sphere entirely by the same reading of the Constitution.</p>
