<p>It appears that the ecumenical efforts over the years are starting
to make progress.  It has been announced today that an agreement
on the doctrines surrounding Mary has been reached and is being
forwarded to the Vatican and the Anglican council.[1] Supposedly
something has happened that now Anglicans can admit that the Church's
teaching is compatible with Scripture (of course it is), and can
be accepted by them.  It remains to be seen if it <em>will</em>
be accepted.  From the fact that it needs to be forwarded to the
Vatican, I take it that it also needs to be determined that those
involved accurately preserved the Church's teaching.  This is
necessary because, despite the claims of many in the protestant
world, and despite the desires of those who would change the Church,
who would "modernize" it, the Church does not invent doctrine, does
not change it, it only clarifies it to defend it from heresies that
once did not exist, and brings it to a wording that will accurately
convey the age old truth in language people today can understand.
This is wonderful news, and I hope that it can be accepted by the
Church (which will mean it is not a change, but simply a better
understanding on the part of the Anglicans (you can see why I am not
and will not likely ever be part of any ecumenical dialog here)),
and is accepted by the Anglicans.  I think it will mean an easier
path home for those lost in the Anglican heresy/schism.  I hope it
will mean that more will find their way home than do currently.
For while the numbers finding their way home may have increased in
the time since the church in England went heretic, not all are home,
and so the numbers are necessarily too few.</p>
