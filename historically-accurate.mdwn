Mr. Matt Drudge reports the rather exciting news that another tidbit of the Bible has been confirmed by (accidental) archeology.[[1]](http://www.drudgereport.com/flash1.htm) In a piece of news that does not seem to have made the more traditional news sites, the Pool of Siloam, apparently thought to have been merely metaphorical, not only actually existed, but was in fact an attraction or place of note, as referenced by the fact that several tiers of stone steps leading to the water have been found. I enjoy this discovery particularly not because I think it necessary confirmation of my faith, but because it is a black eye for those who would dismiss the Bible. It *is* confirmation of the historical accuracy of the Bible for those who do *not* already believe.
