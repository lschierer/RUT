Your **Emotional Intuition**\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#score is a measure of how well you understand people, especially their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#unspoken needs and sympathies. A high score score usually indicates\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#social grace and persuasiveness. A low score usually means you're good\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at Quake.  
Your **Scientific Intuition**\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#score tells you how in tune you are with the world around you; how well\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#you understand your physical and intellectual environment. People with\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#high scores here are apt to succeed in business and, of course, the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#sciences.
