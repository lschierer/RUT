#+TITLE: Altar Servers

"[Pope Benedict XVI] told the many servers gathered that they should be open to the call of the Lord and be prepared if he is calling them to serve as priests."^[[1]](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=7306\ "Pope\ tells\ altar\ servers\ to\ be\ open\ to\ the\ call\ of\ the\ Lord")^ It seems our Pope has the same understanding of the link between serving at the altar and decerning a vocation to the priesthood that I do.
