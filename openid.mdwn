Someone I know from the Pidgin project asked that I install an openid plugin. I am not adverse to the idea, as it should not overly expose me to spam, and so I did some google searching. I found wpopenid on sourceforge, and installed it. It was a pain to get working though, and it is still not working in an ideal state. I cannot figure out how to get it to realize that I have gmp installed on the system. I am not even 100% sure that I \*do\* have gmp installed on the system in a way php5 can recognize. Still, I believe it should work.
