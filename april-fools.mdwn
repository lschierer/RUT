April Fools day passed uneventfully, in that nothing april-fools-day-ish happened. Lauren did not even realize that it \*was\* April Fools Day until it was nearly bedtime. This makes me happy. I am not at all a fan of April Fools Day.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Too bad that it will be on a Monday next year. It will no doubt intrude on my life more significantly.
