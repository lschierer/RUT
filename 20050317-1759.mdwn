So Senate Democrats are reluctant to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#pass a bill to move the Terry Schiavo case into Federal court. "[Debate\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Over Brain-Damaged Woman's Fate Shifts to Congress](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/national/17cnd-schiavo.html?ei=5088&en=ccf532a95e456067&ex=1268715600&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=)" unfortunately\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#requires NYTimes registration, but provides the only article on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#this that I currently see. The House passed a bill that applies\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#not only to this case, but to the class of cases, and apparently\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the Senate doesn't much like that. Further, they are blocking a\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#measure to just apply to this one, though there seems to be some\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#home they will agree on it. Unfortunately, that one in turn, will\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#have trouble in the House, or so it says. Not sure what I think\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of this. I think I am leaning towards wishing they would vote for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#it solely because I am frustrated with the inability of the Florida\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#government to make any headway in protecting her life.
