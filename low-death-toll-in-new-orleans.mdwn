#+TITLE: low death toll in New Orleans

It appears^[[1]](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050912/D8CIM1K80.html)^ that the estimates of thousands dead in New Orleans were grossly inaccurate. The death toll, as the flood waters recede, is currently at about 200. Thank goodness that most people seem to have gotten out or been rescued.

It does raise an important point though, that we need to take the panic reports interlaced with political agendas with a grain of salt when we hear them. When the emphasis appears to be how to blame the President for his [lack of] response, it could be the reports are too quick to believe bad news.
