A while back, someone told me that the purpose of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a business is to make a ton of money, not quite those\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#words, but that was the meaning. This struck me as wrong,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but I did not have the words to refute it at the time. "[The\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Polish pope's role in the fall of communism](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/jackkemp/jk20050404.shtml)" provides some of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#that grounding. Specifically:

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
> Historically, the Christian church had been skeptical\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of capitalism, not because of what the pursuit of profit did to\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#exploit other people but rather because of how the pursuit of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#profit frequently corrupted individuals, making them avaricious,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#envious and materialistic. The pope's encyclical exploded both\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#misconceptions: "The church acknowledges the legitimate role of\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#profit as an indication that a business is functioning well. When\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#a firm makes a profit, this means that productivity factors have\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#been properly employed and corresponding human needs have been duly\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#satisfied. But profitability is not the only indicator of a firm's\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#condition. It is possible for the financial accounts to be in order\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#and yet for the people, who make up the firm's most valuable asset,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to be humiliated and their dignity offended. Besides being morally\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#inadmissible, this will eventually have negative repercussions on\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the firm's economic efficiency. In fact, the purpose of a business\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#firm is not simply to make a profit, but is to be found in its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#very existence as a community of persons who in various ways are\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#endeavoring to satisfy their basic needs and who form a particular\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#group at the service of the whole society."

\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#
This paragraph necessitates that I read "Centesimus Annus" by Pope\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#John Paul II, on which the proceeding quotation appears to be based.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#If the paraphrase and re-think is that good, I can only imagine\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#what the original is like; having read a little of Pope John Paul\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#II's writing, I feel sure that it will not disappoint, it will blow\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#me away. The quote above goes a long way to putting business in its\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#proper place; it pinpoints some of what I disliked about Rackspace\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#as well. Rackspace was making any number of decisions less based\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#on what was good for the customer, as what was *sufficiently*\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#good for the customer as to make them happy while maximizing profit.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Often this was done more or less explicitly at the expense of the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#employees. Support *felt* overworked (I cannot speak to their\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#actual state, I heard conflicting reports from people in different\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#parts of the company), DCOPS certainly was mistreated. Shift work\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#is horrid, that is a given. But there is no question that DCOPS\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#was a poor environment beyond that. It is responsible to sales,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#support, and engineering. It gets blamed for things it does wrong,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#but credit for keeping customers, making, or saving money always goes\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#to one of the departments it is responsible to. So it gets treated\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like "overhead" while without it the company *could not run*.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Support can do many things, but debug hardware problems in a box\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#in a different building several states away is not one of them.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#With 4 guys per shift, 5 if you count the inventory guy, DCOPS also\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#really cannot afford to do as much as either support or sales would\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#like, the ratio of techs to servers is far too low. Additionally,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#the low numbers, kept low solely to reduce the "overhead" that\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#DCOPs is seen as, mean that taking vacations is hard on everyone\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#else in your data center, there are just enough guys to go around,\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#so someone gets to pull double shifts, or some shift gets to go\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#short a guy. Contrast this to the description of business above.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#Obviously Rackspace is failing to function well as a community, the\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#departments end up in conflict, sales against DCOPs against support.\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#The company has its priorities in the wrong place, making product\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#an end instead of a result. Our faith teaches us that if we end\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#at the good of the employee and customer, that while any job has\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#limitations that must be considered, you can create a profitable\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#company without causing the unhappy conditions that yield the high\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#turn over in DCOPs, turn over I was hearing about for a while even\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#after I left, 6 out of the 15 leaving or fired right within a month\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#of my leaving. This rant is rather chaotic, and I am not feeling\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#any flow towards a clean ending, so I am just going to stop here for\#$NEWLINE-MARKER$\#now. I will most likely pick this theme up again at some point.
